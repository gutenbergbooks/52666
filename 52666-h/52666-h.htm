<h2>I.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> every fresh branch of investigation in natural
history has a tendency to gather around it a rapidly
accumulating literature, some explanation may probably
be looked for from an author who offers a new
contribution to the public. And when, as in the
present instance, the writer's intentions are of an
humble kind, it is the more desirable that he should
state his views at the outset. Nor can the force of
this claim be supposed to be lessened, from the gratifying
fact, that the present writer has already received
a warm welcome from the public.</p>

<p>But, before entering upon any personal explanations,
it may not be out of place, in an introductory
chapter such as the present, to bring under
review some of the objections which have been, and
still continue to be urged against this, in common
with other departments of study, which are attempted
to be made popular. No branch of natural history
has been subjected to more disparaging opposition,
partly, it must be owned, from the misplaced enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of over zealous students, than that of marine
zoology.</p>

<p>There are two classes of readers, different in almost
all other respects, whose sympathies are united
in dislike of such works as this. The one, represented
by men distinguished for their powers of
original research, are apt to undervalue the labours
of such as are not, strictly speaking, scientific writers.
There is another class who, from the prejudice of
ignorance, look upon marine zoology as too trivial,
from the homeliness and minuteness of its details.
The wonders of astronomy, and the speculations
suggested by geological studies, nay, the laws of
organization as exhibited in the higher forms of
animal life, are clear enough to this class of readers;
but it is not easy to convince them that design can
be extracted from a mussel, or that a jelly-fish exhibits
a marvellous power of construction.</p>

<p>Now, in my belief, the opposition of the better
educated of these two classes of readers is the more
dangerous, as it is unquestionably the more ungenerous.
If Professor Ansted, when treating of the
surprising neglect of geology, could thus express himself&mdash;'How
many people do we meet, otherwise
well educated, who look with indifference, or even
contempt on this branch of knowledge,'&mdash;how much
oftener may the student of the humble theme of
marine zoology bewail the systematic depreciation of
persons even laying claim to general scientific acquirements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
This may be illustrated by an observation,
made in a northern university, by a celebrated
professor of Greek to a no less celebrated professor
of natural history. The latter, intently pursuing his
researches into the anatomy of a Nudibranche lying
before him, was startled by the sudden entrance of
his brother professor, who contemptuously advised
him to give up skinning slugs, and take to more
manly pursuits.</p>

<p>There is one light in which the study of marine
zoology may be regarded, without necessarily offending
the susceptibilities of the learned, or exciting
the sneers of the ignorant. The subject may be
pursued as an amusement&mdash;a pastime, if you will;
and it is in no higher character than that of a
holiday caterer, that the author asks the reader's
company to the sea-side. No lessons but the simplest
are attempted to be conveyed in this little volume,
and these in as quiet and homely a style as
possible.</p>

<p>Even in the light of an amusement, the author
has something to say in behalf of his favourite study.
He believes it to be as interesting, and fully as
instructive as many infinitely more popular. For
example: The sportsman may love to hear the
whirr of the startled pheasant, as it springs from the
meadow, and seeks safety in an adjoining thicket.
I am as much pleased with the rustling of a simple
crab, that runs for shelter, at my approach, into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
rocky crevice, or beneath a boulder, shaggy with
corallines and sea-weed. He, too, while walking
down some rural lane, may love to see a blackbird
hastily woo the privacy of a hawthorn bush, or a
frightened hare limp across his path, and strive to
hide among the poppies in the corn-field; I am
equally gratified with the sight of a simple razor-fish
sinking into the sand, or with the flash of a silver-bodied

<p>Nay, even the trembling lark that mounts upwards

<p>A disciple of the above mentioned branch of
natural history will dilate with rapture upon the
wondrous transformations which many of his favourite
insects undergo. But none that he can show surpasses
in grandeur and beauty the changes which are
witnessed in many members of the marine animal
kingdom. He points to the leaf, to the bloom upon
the peach, brings his microscope and bids me peer in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and behold the mysteries of creation which his instrument
unfolds. 'Look,' he says, pointing to the
verdant leaf, 'at the myriads of beings that inhabit
this simple object. Every atom,' he exultingly exclaims,
'is a standing miracle, and adorned with
such qualities, as could not be impressed upon it by
a power less than infinite!' Agreed. But has not
the zoologist equal reason to be proud of his science
and its hidden marvels? Can he not exhibit equal
miracles of divine power?</p>

<p>Take, as an example, one of the monsters of the
deep, the whale; and we shall find, according to
several learned writers, that this animal carries on
its back and in its tissues a mass of creatures so
minute, that their number equals that of the entire
population of the globe. A single frond of marine
algæ, in size</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'No bigger than an agate stone<br /></span>

<p>may contain a combination of living zoophytic beings
so infinitely small, that in comparison the 'fairies'
midwife' and her 'team of little atomies' appear
monsters as gigantic, even as the whale or behemoth,
opposed to the gnat that flutters in the brightest
sunbeam.</p>

<p>Again: in a simple drop of sea-water, no larger
than the head of a pin, the microscope will discover
a million of animals. Nay, more; there are some
delicate sea-shells(<i>foraminifera</i>) so minute that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
point of a fine needle at one touch crushes hundreds
of them.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Lastly, How fondly some writers dwell upon the
many touching instances of affection apparent in the
feathered tribe, and narrate how carefully and how
skilfully the little wren, for example, builds its nest,
and tenderly rears its young. I have often watched
the common fowl, and admired her maternal anxiety
to make her outspread wings embrace the whole of
her unfledged brood, and keep them warm. The cat,
too, exhibits this characteristic love of offspring in a
marked degree. She will run after a rude hand that
grasps one of her blind kittens, and, if possible, will
lift the little creature, and run away home with it in
her mouth. Now, whether we look at the singular
skill of the bird building its nest, the hen sitting
near and protecting its brood, or the cat grasping
her young in its jaws, and carrying them home in
safety, we shall find that all these charming traits
are wonderfully combined in one of the humblest
members of the finny tribe, viz., the common stickleback,&mdash;the
little creature that boys catch by thousands
with a worm and a pin,&mdash;that lives equally
content in the clear blue sea or the muddy fresh
water pool.</p>

<p>The author now finds that he has been much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
too prolix in these preliminary observations to leave
himself space for a lengthened explanation of his
reasons for again intruding upon the public. These
are neither original nor profound. But he cannot
help expressing an earnest hope that he may get
credit from old friends, and perhaps from some new,
for wishing to show that the book of nature is as
open as it is varied and inexhaustible; and that,
however jealously guarded are many of the great
secrets of organization, a knowledge of some of the
most familiar objects tends to inspire us alike with
wonder and with awe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is hardly possible to write upon marine zoology
without either more or less alluding to those many
objects, invisible to the naked eye, which call for the
use of the microscope; and it seems equally difficult
for any one who has been accustomed to this instrument
to speak in sober terms of its wonderful revelations.
The lines of Cowper, as the youngest student
in microscopic anatomy will readily acknowledge,
present no exaggerated picture of ecstasy:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is proper, however, to notice that a serious
objection has been urged against the use of the
microscope by young persons, namely, the injurious
effects of its habitual use upon the eyesight.</p>

<p>So far as my experience goes, I cannot deny that
this objection is well founded. Since I have begun
to use the instrument, I am obliged, if I wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
view distinctly any distant object, to distort my eyes
somewhat to the shape of ill-formed button-holes
puckered in the sewing. Some individuals, I am
aware, foolishly affect this appearance, from the notion
that it exhibits an outward and visible sign of their
inward profundity of character. In my own case
this result may have arisen from my having worked
principally at night or in the dusk. 'As to the
sight being injured by a continuous examination of
minute objects,' writes Mr. Clark, a most scientific
naturalist, 'I can truly say this idea is wholly without
foundation, if the pursuit is properly conducted;
and that, on the contrary, it is materially strengthened
by the use of properly adapted glasses, even of
high powers; and in proof I state, that twenty years
ago I used spectacles, but the continued and daily
examination of these minutiæ (<i>foraminifera</i>) has so
greatly increased the power of vision, that I now
read the smallest type without difficulty and without
aid. The great point to be attended to is not to use
a power that in the least exceeds the necessity; not
to continue the exercise of vision too long, and never
by artificial light; and to reserve the high powers
of certain lenses and the microscope for important
investigations of very moderate continuance. The
observant eye seizes at a glance the intelligence
required; whilst strained poring and long optical
exertions are delusive and unsatisfactory, and produce
those fanciful imaginations of objects which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
have really no existence. The proper time for research
after microscopic objects is for <i>one</i> hour after
breakfast, when we are in the fittest state for
exertion.'</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes, again, speaking to the same point, viz.,
the eyes being injured by microscopic studies, says:&mdash;'On
evidence the most conclusive I deny the accusation.
My own eyes, unhappily made delicate by
over-study in imprudent youth, have been employed
for hours daily over the microscope without injury
or fatigue. By artificial light, indeed, I find it very
trying; but by daylight, which on all accounts is
the best light for the work, it does not produce more
fatigue than any other steadfast employment of the
eye. Compared with looking at pictures, for instance,
the fatigue is as nothing.'</p>

<p>In spite of the foregoing assertions, I feel it my
duty to caution the student against excess of labour.
Let him ride his hobby cautiously, instead of seeking
to enrol his name among the martyrs of science, of
whom the noble Geoffry St. Hilaire, M. Sauvigny,
and M. Strauss Dürckheim, are noted modern examples.
Each member of this celebrated trio spent
the latter part of his existence in physical repose,
having become totally blind from intense study over
the microscope. But setting aside the evils of
excess, we must bear witness to the intense delight
which this pursuit affords when followed with
moderation.</p>

<p>As my aim is merely to give the reader a taste of
the subject, and whet his appetite for its more extensive
pursuit at other sources, I shall confine my remarks
to a few of those creatures which are readily
to be found in any well-stocked aquarium. The
number of animalculæ and microscopic zoospores of
plants, invisible to the naked eye, with which such a
receptacle is filled, even when the water is clear as
crystal, is truly marvellous. These animals mostly
belong to the class <i>Infusoria</i>, so called from their
being found to be invariably generated in any <i>infusion</i>,
or solution of vegetable or animal matter, which
has begun to decay. Now, the water in an aquarium
which has been kept for any length of time necessarily
becomes more or less charged with the effete
matter of its inhabitants, which, if allowed to accumulate,
would soon render the fluid poisonous to
every living thing within it. This result is happily
averted by the Infusoria, which feed upon the decaying
substances in solution, while they themselves become
in their turn the food of the larger animals.
Indeed, they constitute almost the sole nutriment of
many strong, muscular shell-fish, as pholas, mussel,
cockle, &amp;c.; and doubtless help to maintain the life of
others, such as actiniæ, and even crabs, which, as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
well known, live and grow without any other apparent
means of sustenance. Thus the presence of
Infusoria in the tank may be considered a sign of its
healthy condition, although their increase to such an
extent as to give a milky appearance to the water,
is apt to endanger the well-being of the larger,
though delicate creatures. The peculiar phenomenon
alluded to arises from decaying matter, such as a dead
worm or limpet, which should be sought after and
removed with all possible speed. The whereabouts
of such objectionable remains will be generally indicated
by a dense cloud of Infusoria hovering over the
spot. The milkiness, however, although it may look
for the time unsightly, is ofttimes the saving of the
aquarium 'stock.' When these tiny but industrious
scavengers have completed their task of purification,
they will cease to multiply, and mostly disappear,
leaving the water clear as crystal. I believe it
is the absence or deficient supply of Infusoria that
sometimes so tantalizingly defeats the attempts of
many persons to establish an aquarium. Pure deep-sea
water, although never without them, often contains
but very few, hence great caution is necessary
not to overstock the tank filled with it, otherwise the
animals will die rapidly, although the water itself
appears beautifully transparent.</p>

<p>Of Infusoria there are many species. They are
nearly all, at one stage or other of their existence,
extremely vivacious in their movements; so much so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
indeed, that it becomes a matter of difficulty to observe
them closely. Some have the power of darting
about with astonishing velocity, others unceasingly
gyrate, or waltz around with the grace of a
Cellarius; while not a few content themselves by,
slug-like, dragging their slow length along. The
last are frequently startled from their propriety and
aplomb by the rapid evolutions of their terpshicorean
neighbours. Some, again, grasping hold of an object
by one of their long filaments, revolve rapidly round it,
whilst others spring, leap, and perform sundry feats
of acrobatism that are unmatched in dexterity by any
of the larger animals.</p>

<p>I may here observe that the motions and general
structure of many of the microscopic forms of vegetation,
so much resemble those of some of the infusoria,
that it has long puzzled naturalists to distinguish between
them with any degree of certainty. The
chief distinction appears to lie in the nature of their
food. Those forms which are truly vegetable can
live upon purely inorganic matter, while the animals
require that which is organized. The plants also
live entirely by the absorption of fluid through the
exterior, while the animalculæ are capable of taking in
solid particles into the interior of the body. Their mode
of multiplication, and the metamorphoses they undergo,
are much alike in both classes, being, during one
stage of their existence, still and sometimes immovably
fixed to stones, sea-weed, &amp;c., and at another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
freely swimming about. Notwithstanding the similarities
here stated, the appearance of certain of the
species is as various as it is curious. One of the
commonest species of the Infusoria (<i>Paramecium
caudatum</i>) is shaped somewhat like a grain of rice,
with a piece chipped out on one side, near the extremity
of its body. It swims about with its unchipped
extremity foremost, rotating as it goes.
During the milky condition of the water (before
alluded to), these creatures swarm to such a degree,
that a single drop of the fluid, when placed under
the microscope, appears filled with a dense cloud of
dancing midges. Another (<i>Kerona silurus</i>) may be
said to resemble a coffee-bean, with a host of <i>cilia</i>,
or short bristles, on the flat side. These are used
when swimming or running. But perhaps the most
singular and beautiful of all the infusorial animalcules
are the <i>Vorticellæ</i>, which resemble minute cups or
flower-bells, mounted upon slender retractile threadlike
stalks, by which they are moored to the surface
of the weeds and stones. They are called Vorticellæ
on account of the little vortices or whirlpools which
they continually create in the water, by means of a
fringe of very minute cilia placed round the brim of
their cups. These cilia are so minute as to require
a very high microscopic power to make them
visible, and even then they are not easily detected,
on account of their extremely rapid vibration, which
never relaxes while the animal is in full vigour. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the other hand, when near death, their velocity
diminishes, and ample opportunity is afforded for observing
that the movements consist of a rapid bending
inwards and outwards, over the edge of the cup.
This is best seen in a side view. The action is repeated
by each cilium in succession, with such rapidity and
regularity that, when viewed from above, the fringe
looks like the rim of a wheel in rapid revolution.
A similar appearance, produced by the same cause,
in another class of animalcula, of much more complex
structure than the Vorticellæ, has procured for
it the name of <i>Rotifera</i>, or wheel-bearers. The
result of this combined movement of the cilia is,
that a constant stream of water is drawn in towards
the centre of the cup, and thrown off over the sides,
when, having reached a short distance beyond the
edge, it circles rapidly in a small vortex, curling
downwards over the lips. These currents are rendered
evident by floating particles in the water. The
possession of these vibratile cilia is not peculiar to
this class of animals; indeed, there is good reason to
believe that there is scarcely a living creature, from
the lowest animalcule, or plant germ, up to man
himself, that is not provided with them in some part
or other. In many of these Infusoria the cilia constitute
the organs of locomotion; while in the higher
forms they serve various other purposes, but chiefly
that of directing the flow of the various internal
fluids through their proper channels. But the peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and perhaps most wonderful organ of the Vorticella,
is its stalk or mooring thread. This though
generally of such extreme tenuity as to be almost
invisible with ordinary microscopes, yet exhibits a
remarkable degree of strength and muscular activity
in its movements, which apparently are more voluntary
than those of the cilia. Its action consists of
a sudden contraction from a straight to a spiral
form with the coils closely packed together, by
which the head or bell is jerked down almost into
contact with the foot of the stalk; after a few seconds
the tension seems gradually relaxed, the coils are
slowly unwound, and the stalk straightens itself out.
This action takes place at irregular intervals, but it
is seldom that more than a minute elapses between
each contraction. It (the contraction) invariably
happens when the animal is touched or alarmed, and
is, consequently, very frequent when the water
swarms with many other swimming animalcula.
When it takes place the flower-bell generally closes
up into a little round ball, which opens out again
only when the stalk becomes fully extended. From
this we might almost infer that some animalcule, or
other morsel of food, had been seized and retained
within the cup; moreover, that the contraction of the
stalk assisted in securing or disposing of the prey.
This, however, is uncertain.</p>

<p>The motions of the Vorticella do not seem much
affected by the stalk losing hold of its attachment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
but the result of such an accident taking place is
that the cilia cause the animal to swim through the
water, trailing its thread behind it, and the contraction
of the latter merely causes it to be drawn up to
the head.</p>

<p>There are various species of Vorticellæ. That just
described is the simplest, consisting merely of a
hemispherical ciliated cup, attached to a single thread.
It is barely visible to the naked eye. But there is
a compound species which I have this year found to
be extremely abundant in my aquarium,&mdash;whose
occupants, both large and small, it excels in singularity
and beauty. In structure it is to the simple
Vorticella what a many-branched zoophyte is to
an <i>Actinia</i>. My attention was first drawn to
the presence of this creature by observing some
pebbles and fronds of green ulva thickly coated
with a fine flocculent down. On closer inspection
this growth appeared to consist of a multitude of
feathery plumes, about one-sixteenth of an inch in
height, and individually of so fine and transparent a
texture as to be scarcely discernible to the unassisted
sight. On touching one with the point of a fine
needle it would instantly shrink up into a small but
dense mass, like a ball of white cotton&mdash;scarcely so
large as a fine grain of sand. In a few seconds it
would again unfold and spread itself out to its original
size. By carefully detaching a specimen with
the point of a needle or pen-knife, and transferring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it, along with a drop of water upon a slip of glass,
to the stage of the microscope, a sight was presented
of great wonder and loveliness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">'The more I fixed mine eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mine eye the more new wonders did espye!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let the reader imagine a tree with slender, gracefully
curved, and tapering branches thickly studded
over with delicate flower-bells in place of leaves.
Let him suppose the bells to be shaped somewhat
between those of the fox-glove and convolvolus, and
the stem, branches, bells, and all, made of the purest
crystal. Let him further conceive every component
part of this singular structure to be tremulous
with life-like motion, and he will have as correct
an idea as words can give of the complex form of
this minute inhabitant of the deep. Moreover, while
gazing at it through the microscope, the observer is
startled by the sudden collapse of the entire structure.
The lovely tree has shrunk together into a dense ball,
in which the branching stem lies completely hidden
among the flower-bells&mdash;themselves closed up into
little spherules, so closely packed together that the
entire mass resembles a piece of herring-roe. This
contraction is so instantaneous that the mode in
which it is accomplished cannot be observed until
the tree is again extended. As the re-extension
takes place very slowly, we are enabled to observe
that each branchlet has been coiled in a spiral form,
like the thread of the simple Vorticella previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
described; and also that the main stem, above the
lowest branch, was coiled up in the same way, but
not so closely, and that the part below the lowest
branch had, curiously enough, remained straight.
Sometimes, in large and numerously branched specimens,
one or two of the lowest members do not
contract at the same time with the rest, but do so
immediately afterwards, as if they had been startled
by the shrinking movements of their neighbours.
Sometimes these lowest branches will contract alone,
while all the others remain fully extended,&mdash;a fact
that would almost seem to indicate that they possessed
an independent life of their own.</p>

<p>In the accompanying engraving I have attempted
faithfully to portray one of these wonderful creatures.
Fig. 1 represents it fully extended, while Fig. 2 indicates
its collapsed form. There is another curious
circumstance which I have fortunately observed in
connection with this Vorticella, a description of which
will perhaps be interesting to the reader. I allude
to the casting off of what may be called the fruit of
the tree. When this event takes place, the buds (or
fruit) dart about with such rapidity, that it is almost
impossible to keep them in the field of view for the
briefest space of time. A represents the enchanted
fruit hanging on the tree; B shows it as it swims
about.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;"><a name="Illus2" id="Illus2">

</a></div>

<p>Although not exactly fruit, it is, no doubt, the
means by which the Vorticellæ are propagated, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
is known that many fixed zoophytes, and even some
plants, produce free swimming germs or spores, which
afterwards become fixed, and grow up into forms like
those which produced them. In some of the branching
zoophytes (<i>Coryne</i>, <i>Sertularia</i>, &amp;c.), the germs are
exactly like little medusae, being small, gelatinous
cups fringed with tentacula, by means of which they
twitch themselves along with surprising agility. In
this Vorticella, however, it is more like one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
ciliated Infusoria.  The first one that I saw attached
I conceived to be a remarkably large bell, with its
mouth directed towards me, but the cilia with which
it appeared to be fringed were unusually large and
distinct.  The movements of these appendages being
comparatively slow, it was most interesting to watch
them as they successively bent inwards and rose
again, like the steady swell of a tidal wave, or an
eccentric movement in some piece of machinery,
making a revolution about twice in a second, and in
the opposite direction to the hands of a clock. Suddenly
the tree contracted, when, to my surprise, I
observed the bell, which not an instant before appeared
attached, now floating freely in the water, its
ciliary movements not being in the least interrupted.
Presently, however, they became brisker, the bell
turned over on its side, and, ere the tree had again
expanded, darted out of view, not, however, before I
had remarked that it was not a bell, but a sphere
flattened on one side, and having its circular ring of
cilia on the flat side, with only a slight depression in
the middle of it.  There also appeared to be a small
granular nucleus immediately above this depression,
the rest of the body being perfectly transparent. I
afterwards saw several others attached to the tree,
each seated about the centre of a branch; but none
of these were so fully developed. They were like
little transparent button mushrooms, and had all
more or less of a nucleus on the side by which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
were attached. On only one of these did I detect
any cilia.</p>

<p>Mr. Gosse, in his 'Tenby,' gives a picture of an
animal exceedingly like what I have described; but
from his account of it, there seems to be some
doubt of their identity. He calls it '<i>Zoothamnium
spirale</i>,' because the insertions of the branches were
placed spirally around the main stem, like those of
a fir-tree. In my specimens the branches were set
alternately on opposite sides of the main trunk, and
the whole was curved like a drooping fern leaf or
an ostrich feather, the bells being mostly set on the
convex side.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me mention that it is an error
to suppose, as many persons do, that putrid water
alone contains life. Infusoria occur, as before hinted,
in the clear waters of the ocean, in the water that
we drink daily, and also in the limpid burn that
flows through our valleys, or trickles like a silver
thread down the mountain side.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h2>III.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> marine objects have become more universally
popular of late years than Sea Anemones. Certainly
none better deserve the attention which has been,
and is daily bestowed upon them by thousands of
amateur naturalists, who cannot but be delighted
with the wondrous variety of form, and the
beauteous colouring which these zoophytes possess.</p>

<p>A stranger could scarcely believe, on looking into
an aquarium, that the lovely object before him, seated
motionless at the base of the vessel, with tentacula
expanded in all directions, was not a simple daisy
newly plucked from the mountain side, or it may be
a blooming marigold or <i>Anemone</i> from some rich
parterre&mdash;instead of being, in reality, a living, moving,
animal-flower.</p>

<p>One great advantage which the <i>Actiniæ</i> possess
over certain other inhabitants of the sea-shore, at
least to the eye of the naturalist, is the facility with
which specimens may be procured for observation
and study. Scarcely any rock-pool near low water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
mark but will be found to encompass a certain number
of these curious creatures, while some rocky
excavations of moderate size will at times contain as
many as fifty. Should the tide be far advanced,
the young zoologist need not despair of success, for,
by carefully examining the under part of the
boulders totally uncovered by the sea, he will
frequently find specimens of the smooth anemone,
contracted and hanging listlessly from the surface
of the stone, like masses of green, marone, or crimson
jelly.</p>

<p>The Actiniæ, and especially examples of the above
mentioned species, are extremely hardy and tenacious
of life, as the following interesting narrative will
prove.</p>

<p>The late Sir John Dalyell writing in 1851, says,
'I took a specimen of <i>A. mesembryanthemum</i> (smooth
anemone) in August 1828, at North Berwick, where
the species is very abundant among the crevices of
the rocks, and in the pools remaining still replenished
after the recess of the tide. It was originally very
fine, though not of the largest size, and I computed
from comparison with those bred in my possession,
that it must have been then at least seven years old.'</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Dr. M'Bain, R.N., the
writer has been permitted to enjoy the extreme
pleasure of inspecting the venerable zoophyte above
alluded to, which cannot now be much under thirty-eight
years of age!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>In the studio of the above accomplished naturalist,
'Granny' (as she has been amusingly christened)
still dwells, her wants being attended to with all
that tenderness and care which her great age
demands.</p>

<p>Sir J. Dalyell informs us that during a period of
twenty years this creature produced no less than
344 young ones. But, strange to say, nearly
the fortieth part of this large progeny consisted of
monstrous animals, the monstrosity being rather
by redundance than defect. One, for instance, was
distinguished by two mouths of unequal dimensions
in the same disc, environed by a profusion of tentacula.
Each mouth fed independently of its fellow,
and the whole system seemed to derive benefit
from the repast of either. In three years this monster
became a fine specimen, its numerous tentacula were
disposed in four rows, whereas only three characterize
the species, and the tubercles of vivid purple,
regular and prominent, at that time amounted to
twenty-eight.</p>

<p>From the foregoing statement we learn that this
extraordinary animal produced about 300 young
during a period of twenty years, but, 'wonder of
wonders!' I have now to publish the still more
surprising fact, that in the spring of the year
1857, after being unproductive for many years, it
unexpectedly gave birth, during a single night, to
no less than 240 living models of its illustrious self!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>This circumstance excited the greatest surprise
and pleasure in the mind of the late Professor Fleming,
in whose possession this famous Actinia then
was.</p>

<p>Up to this date (January 1860) there has been
no fresh instance of fertility on the part of Granny,
whose health, notwithstanding her great reproductive
labours and advanced age, appears to be all that
her warmest friends and admirers could desire. Nor
does her digestive powers exhibit any signs of weakness
or decay; on the contrary, that her appetite is
still exquisitely keen, I had ample opportunity of
judging. The half of a newly opened mussel being
laid gently upon the outer row of tentacula, these
organs were rapidly set in motion, and the devoted
mollusc engulphed in the course of a few seconds.</p>

<p>The colour of this interesting pet is pale brown.
Its size, when fully expanded, no larger than a half-crown
piece. It is not allowed to suffer any annoyance
by being placed in companionship with the
usual occupants of an aquarium, but dwells alone in
a small tank, the water of which is changed regularly
once a week. This being the plan adopted by the
original owner of Granny, is the one still followed
by Dr. M'Bain, whose anxiety is too great to allow
him to pursue any other course, for fear of accident
thereby occurring to his protegée.</p>

<p><a href="#Illus3">A portrait of Granny, drawn from nature</a>, will
be found on Plate 2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A. troglodytes</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (cave-dweller) is a very common,
but interesting object. The members of this species
are especial favourites with the writer, from their
great suitableness for the aquarium. They vary
considerably in their appearance from each other.
Some are red, violet, purple, or fawn colour; others
exhibit a mixture of these tints, while not a few are
almost entirely white. There are certain specimens
which disclose tentacula, that in colour and character
look, at a little distance, like a mass of eider-down
spread out in a circular form. A better comparison,
perhaps, presents itself in the smallest plumage of a
bird beautifully stippled, and radiating from a centre.
The centre is the mouth of the zoophyte, and is
generally a light buff or yellow colour. From each
corner, in certain specimens, there branches out a
white horn that tapers to a very delicate point, and
is oft times gracefully curled like an Ionic volute, or
rather like the tendril of a vine.</p>

<p>In addition to the pair of horns alluded to, may
sometimes be seen a series of light-coloured rays,
occurring at regular intervals around the circumference
of the deep tinted tentacula, and thereby producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to the eye of the beholder a most pleasing
effect.</p>

<p>As a general rule, never attempt to capture an
anemone unless it be fully expanded, before commencing
operations. By this means you will be
able to form a pretty accurate estimate of its appearance
in the tanks. This condition of being seen
necessitates, of course, its being covered with water,
and, consequently, increases the difficulty of capturing
your prize, especially when the creature happens to
have taken up a position upon a combination of
stone and solid rock, or in a crevice, or in a muddy
pool, which when disturbed seems as if it would
never come clear again.</p>

<p>It is, in consequence, advisable to search for those
situated in shallow water, the bottom of which is
covered with clean sand. When such a favourable
spot is found, take hammer and chisel and commence
operations. Several strokes may be given before any
alarm is caused to the anemone, provided it be not
actually touched. No sooner, however, does the
creature feel a palpable vibration, and suspect the
object of such disturbance, than, spurting up a stream
of water, it infolds its blossom, and shrinks to its
smallest possible compass. At same time apparently
tightens its hold of the rock, and is, indeed, often
enabled successfully to defy the utmost efforts to
dislodge it.</p>

<p>After a little experience, the zoologist will be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to guess whether he is likely to succeed in getting his
prize perfect and entire; if not, let me beg of him not
to persevere, but immediately try some other place,
and hope for better fortune.</p>

<p>Although apparently sedentary creatures, the Actiniæ
often prove themselves to be capable of moving about
at will over any portion of their subaqueous domain.
Having selected a particular spot, they will ofttimes
remain stationary there many consecutive months.
A smooth anemone that had been domesticated for
a whole year in my aquarium thought fit to change
its station and adopt a roving life, but at last
'settled down,' much to my surprise, upon a large
mussel suspended from the surface of the glass.
Across both valves of the mytilus the 'mess.' attached
by its fleshy disc, remained seated for a considerable
length of time. It was my opinion that the mussel
would eventually be sacrificed. Such, however, was
not the case, for on the zoophyte again starting off
on a new journey, the mollusc showed no palpable
signs of having suffered from the confinement to
which it had so unceremoniously been subjected.</p>

<p>The appearance of this anemone situated several
inches from the base of the vessel, branching out
from such an unusual resting-place, and being swayed
to and fro, as it frequently was, by the contact of a
passing fish, afforded a most pleasing sight to my
eye. Indeed, it was considered for a while one of
the 'lions' of the tank, and often became an object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of admiration not only to my juvenile visitors, but
also to many 'children of larger growth.'</p>

<p>There is a curious fact in connection with the
Actiniæ which deserves to be chronicled here. I
allude to the apparent instinct which they possess.
This power I have seen exercised at various times.
The following is a somewhat remarkable instance of
the peculiarity in question.</p>

<p>In a small glass vase was deposited a choice <i>A.
dianthus</i>, about an inch in diameter. The water in
the vessel was at least five inches in depth. Having
several specimens of the <i>Aplysiæ</i>, I placed one in
companionship with the anemone, and was often
amused to observe the former floating head downward
upon the surface of the water. After a while
it took up a position at the base of the vase, and
remained there for nearly a week. Knowing the
natural sluggishness of the animal, its passiveness
did not cause me any anxiety. I was rather
annoyed, however, at observing that the fluid was
becoming somewhat opaque, and that the Dianthus
remained entirely closed, and intended to find out the
cause of the phenomena, but from some reason or other
failed to carry out this laudable purpose at the time.
After the lapse of a few days, on looking into the tank,
I was delighted to perceive the lace-like tentacula of
the actinia spread out on the surface of the water,
which had become more muddy-looking than before.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that the impurity in question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
arose from the Aplysia (whose presence in the tank
I had forgotten) having died, and its body being
allowed to remain in the vessel in a decaying state.
The deceased animal on being removed emitted an
effluvium so intolerably bad that it seemed like the
concentrated essence of vile odours. The water, of
course, must have been of the most deadly character,
yet had this most delicate of sea-anemones existed
in it for several consecutive days.</p>

<p>In order further to test how long my little captive
would remain alive in its uncongenial habitation, I
cruelly refused to grant any succour, but must own
to having felt extremely gratified at perceiving, in
the course of a few days, that instead of remaining
with its body elongated to such an unusual extent,
the Dianthus gradually advanced along the base,
then up the side of the vessel, and finally located
itself in a certain spot, from which it could gain easy
access to the outer atmosphere.</p>

<p>After this second instance of intelligence (?) I
speedily transferred my pet to a more healthy
situation.</p>

<p>Having procured a small colony of Actiniæ, you
need be under no anxiety about their diet, for they
will exist for years without any further subsistence
than is derived from the fluid in which they live.
Yet strange as the statement will appear to many
persons, the Actiniæ are generally branded with the
character of being extremely greedy and voracious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
'Nothing,' says Professor Jones, 'can escape their
deadly touch. Every animated thing that comes in
contact with them is instantly caught, retained, and
mercilessly devoured. Neither strength nor size, nor
the resistance of the victim, can daunt the ravenous
captor. It will readily grasp an animal, which, if
endowed with similar strength, advantage, and
resolution, could certainly rend its body asunder. It
will endeavour to gorge itself with thrice the quantity
of food that its most capacious stomach is
capable of receiving. Nothing is refused, provided
it be of animal substance. All the varieties of the
smaller fishes, the fiercest of the crustacea, the most
active of the annelidans, and the soft tenants of
shells among the mollusca, all fall a prey to the
Actiniæ.'</p>

<p>This is a sweeping statement, and, although corroborated
by Sir J. Dalyell and others, is one that
requires to be received with a certain degree of
caution. It most certainly does not apply to <i>A.
bellis</i>, <i>A. parisitica</i>, <i>A. dianthus</i>, <i>troglodytes</i>, or any
other members of this group; and to a very limited
extent only is it applicable to <i>A. coriacea</i> or <i>A.
mesembryanthemum</i>.</p>

<p>As may readily be conceived, the writer could not
keep monster specimens, such as are often found at
the sea-shore; but surely if the statement were
correct that, <i>as a general rule</i>, the actiniæ eat living
crabs, the phenomenon would occasionally occur with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
moderate-sized specimens, when kept in companionship
with a mixed assembly of crustaceans. Yet in
no single instance have I witnessed a small crab
sacrificed to the gluttony of a small anemone.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>A. mesembryanthemum</i>, <i>A. bellis</i>,
and <i>A. dianthus</i>, they get so accustomed to the
presence of their crusty neighbours, as not to retract
their expanded tentacula when a hermit crab, for
instance, drags his lumbering mansion across, or a
fiddler crab steps through the delicate rays, like a
sky terrier prancing over a bed of tulips.</p>

<p>Thus much I have felt myself called upon to say
in defence of certain species of Actiniæ; but with
regard to <i>A. crassicornis</i>, I must candidly own the
creature is greedy and voracious to an extreme
degree.</p>

<p>Like many other writers, I have seen scores of
this species of Actiniæ that contained the remains of
crabs of large dimensions, but at one time considered
that the latter were dead specimens, which had
been drifted by the tide within reach of the Actiniæ,
and afterwards consumed. That such, indeed, was the
correct explanation in many instances I can scarcely
doubt, from the disproportionate bigness of the crabs
as compared with the anemones, but feel quite confident,
that in other instances, the crustacea were
alive when first caught by their voracious companions.</p>

<p>To test the power of the 'crass.,' I have frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
chosen a specimen well situated for observation,
and dropped a crab upon its tentacula.
Instantly the intruding animal was grasped (perhaps
merely by a claw), but in spite of its struggles to
escape, was slowly drawn into the mouth of its
captor, and eventually consumed. In one case, after
the crab had been lost to view for the space of three
minutes only, I drew it out of the Actinia, but
although not quite dead, it evidently did not seem
likely to survive for any length of time.</p>

<p>In collecting Actiniæ great care should be taken
in detaching them from their position. If possible,
it is far the better plan not to disturb them, but to
transport them to the aquarium on the piece of rock
or other substance to which they may happen to be
affixed. This can in general be done by a smart
blow of the chisel and hammer.</p>

<p>Should the attempt fail, an endeavour should be
made to insinuate the finger nails under the base,
and so detach each specimen uninjured. This operation
is a delicate one, requiring practice, much
patience, and no little skill. We are told by some
authors that a slight rent is of no consequence, since
the anemone is represented as having the power of
darning it up. It may be so, but for my part I am
inclined in other instances to consider the statement
more facetious than truthful. In making this
remark, I allude solely to the disc of the animal, an
injury to which I have never seen repaired. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
other hand, it is well known that certain other parts
may be destroyed with impunity. If the tentacula,
for instance, be cut away, so great are the reproductive
powers of the Actiniæ, that in a comparatively
short space of time the mutilated members
will begin to bud anew.</p>

<p>'If cut transversely through the middle, the lower
portion of the body will after a time produce more
tentacula, pretty near as they were before the operation,
while the upper portion swallows food as if
nothing had happened, permitting it indeed at first
to come out at the opposite end; just as if a man's
head being cut off would let out at the neck the bit
taken in at the mouth, but which it soon learns to
retain and digest in a proper manner.'</p>

<p>The smooth anemone being viviparous, as already
hinted, it is no uncommon circumstance for the
naturalist to find himself unexpectedly in possession
of a large brood of infant zoophytes, which have
been ejected from the mouth of the parent.</p>

<p>There is often an unpleasant-looking film surrounding
the body of the Actiniæ. This 'film' is
the skin of the animal, and is cast off very frequently.
It should be brushed away by aid of a
camel-hair pencil. Should any rejected food be
attached to the lips, it may be removed by the same
means. When in its native haunts this process is
performed daily and hourly by the action of the
waves.  Such attention to the wants of his little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
captives should not be grudgingly, but lovingly performed
by the student. His labour frequently meets
with ample reward, in the improved appearance
which his specimens exhibit. Instead of looking
sickly and weak, with mouth pouting, and tentacula
withdrawn, each little pet elevates its body and gracefully
spreads out its many rays, apparently for no
other purpose than to please its master's eye.</p>

<p><i>A. mesembryanthemum</i> (in colloquial parlance
abbreviated to 'mess.'), is very common at the sea-shore.
It is easily recognised by the row of blue
torquoise-like beads, about the size of a large
pin's head, that are situated around the base of the
tentacula. This test is an unerring one, and can
easily be put in practice by the assistance of a small
piece of stick, with which to brush aside the overhanging
rays.</p>

<p><i>A. crassicornis</i> grows to a very large size. Some
specimens would, when expanded, cover the crown of
a man's hat, while others are no larger than a
'bachelor's button.' Unless rarely marked, I do not
now introduce the 'crass.' into my tanks, from a
dislike, which I cannot conquer, to the strange peculiarity
which members of this species possess, of
turning themselves inside out, and going through a
long series of inelegant contortions. Still, to the
young zoologist, this habit will doubtless be interesting
to witness. One author has named these large
anemones 'quilled dahlias;' and the expression is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
felicitous, that if a stranger at the sea-side bear
it in mind, he could hardly fail to identify the 'crass.,'
were he to meet with a specimen in a rocky pool.
Not the least remarkable feature in connection with
these animal-flowers, is the extraordinary variety of
colouring which various specimens display.</p>

<p><i>A. troglodytes</i>, is seldom found larger than a florin.
Its general size is that of a shilling. From the
description previously given, the reader will be able
to make the acquaintance of this anemone without
any trouble whatever.</p>

<p><i>A. dianthus</i> (Plumose anemone), is one of the most
delicately beautiful of all the Actiniæ; it can, moreover,
be very readily identified in its native haunts.
Its colour is milky-white,&mdash;body, base, and tentacula,
all present the same chaste hue. Specimens, however,
are sometimes found lemon-coloured, and
occasionally of a deep orange tint. Various are the
forms which this zoophyte assumes, yet each one is
graceful and elegant.</p>

<p>The most remarkable as well as the most common
shape, according to my experience, is that of a lady's
corset, such as may often be seen displayed in
fashionable milliners' windows. Even to the slender
waist, the interior filled with a mass of lace-work,
the rib-like streaks, and the general contour, suggestive
of the Hogarthian line of beauty, the likeness
is sustained.</p>

<p>When entirely closed, this anemone, unlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
many others, is extremely flat, being scarcely more
than a quarter of an inch in thickness; indeed, so
extraordinary is the peculiarity to which I allude,
that a novice would have great difficulty in believing
that the object before him was possessed of expansive
powers at all, whereas, in point of fact, it is even
more highly gifted in this respect than any other
species of Actiniæ.</p>

by 'dear Tom Hood,' which appeared in one of his
comic annuals,&mdash;or volumes of 'Laughter from <i>year</i>

the fishmongers' shops. However that may be, there
is no doubt it was a specimen of this genus that
Creel Katie so boldly captured.</p>

<p>Now this crab, to my mind, is one of the most
interesting objects of the marine animal kingdom,
and I would strongly advise those of my readers who
may have opportunities of being at the sea-side to
procure a few youthful specimens. Its habits, according
to my experience, are quite different from
those of its relative, the Common Shore-Crab (<i>Carcinus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
<i>mænas</i>), or even the Velvet Swimming-Crab (<i>Portunus
puber</i>). Unlike these, it does not show any signs of a
vicious temper upon being handled, nor does it scamper
away in hot haste at the approach of a stranger. Its
nature, strange as the statement may appear to many
persons, seems timid, gentle, and fawn-like.</p>

<p>On turning over a stone, you will perhaps perceive,
as I have often done, three or four specimens, and,
unless previously aware of the peculiarity of their
disposition, you will be surprised to see each little
fellow immediately fall upon his back, turn up the
whites of his eyes, and bring his arms or claws
together,&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>making just such a silent appeal for mercy as
a pet spaniel does when expecting from his master
chastisement for some <i>faux pas</i>. One of these crabs
may be taken up and placed in the hand without
the slightest fear. It will not attempt to escape,
but will passively submit to be rolled about, and
closely examined at pleasure. Even when again
placed in its native element, minutes will sometimes
elapse before the little creature can muster up courage
to show his 'peepers,' and gradually unroll its body
and limbs from their painful contraction.</p>

<p>Most writers on natural history entertain an opinion
totally at variance with my own in regard to
the poor <i>Cancer pagurus</i>, of whom we are speaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
By some he is called a fierce, cannibalistic, and remorseless
villain, totally unfit to be received into
respectable marine society. Mr. Jones relates how
he put half a dozen specimens into a vase, and on the
following day found that, with the exception of two,
all had been killed and devoured by their companions;
and in a trial of strength which speedily ensued between
the pair of 'demons in crustaceous guise,' one
of these was eventually immolated and devoured by
his inveterate antagonist. Sir J. Dalyell mentions
several similar instances of rapacity among these animals.
Now, these anecdotes I do not doubt, but feel
inclined, from the results of my own experience, to
consider them exceptional cases.</p>

<p>When studying the subject of exuviation, I
was in the habit of keeping half a dozen or
more specimens of the Edible Crab together as companions
in the same vase; but except when a 'friend
and brother' slipped off his shelly coat, and thus
offered a temptation too great for crustaceous nature
to withstand, I do not remember a single instance of
cannibalism. True, there certainly were occasionally
quarrelling and fighting, and serious nocturnal broils,
whereby life and limb were endangered; but then such
mishaps will frequently occur, even in the best regulated
families of the higher animals, without these
being denounced as a parcel of savages.</p>

<p>Compared to <i>Cancer pagurus</i>, the Shore-Crab appears
in a very unamiable light. When the two are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
kept in the same vase, they exhibit a true exemplification
of the wolf and the lamb.  This, much to
my chagrin, was frequently made evident to me,
but more particularly so on one occasion, when I
was, from certain circumstances, compelled to place
a specimen of each in unhappy companionship. Here
is a brief account of how they behaved to each other:
The poor little lamb (<i>C. pagurus</i>) was kept in a
constant state of alarm by the attacks of her fellow-prisoner
(<i>C. mænas</i>) from the first moment that I
dropped her in the tank.  If I gave her any food,
and did not watch hard by until it was consumed,
the whole meal would to a certainty be snatched
away.  Not content with his booty, the crabbie
rascal of the shore would inflict a severe chastisement
upon his rival in my favour, and not unfrequently
attempt to wrench off an arm or a leg out
of sheer wantonness. To end such a deplorable state
of matters, I very unceremoniously took up wolf,
and lopped off one of his large claws, and also one of
his hind legs.  By this means I stopped his rapid
movements to and fro, and, moreover, deprived him
somewhat of his power to grasp an object forcibly.
In spite of his mutilations, he still exhibited the
same antipathy to his companion, and, as far as possible,
made her feel the weight of his jealous ire.
Retributive justice, however, was hanging over his
crustaceous head.  The period arrived when nature
compelled him to change his coat.  In due time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
mysterious operation was performed, and he stood
forth a new creature, larger in size, handsomer in
appearance, but for a few days weak, sickly, and
defenceless. His back, legs, and every part of his
body were of the consistency of bakers' dough. The
lamb well knew her power, and though much smaller
in size than her old enemy, she plucked up spirit
and attacked him; nor did she desist until she had
seemingly made him cry peccavi, and run for his life
beneath the shelter of some friendly rock. Without
wishing to pun, I may truly say the little partane
came off with <i>eclat</i>, having my warmest approbation
for her conduct, and a <i>claw</i> in her arms as token of
her prowess. I knew that when wolf was himself
again there would be a scene. Reprisals, of course,
would follow. Therefore, rather than permit a continuance
of such encounters, I separated the crabs,
and introduced them to companions more suited to
the nature of each.</p>

<p>The difference exhibited in the form and development
of the tail in the ten-footed Crustacea (<i>Decapoda</i>)&mdash;as
for instance, the crab, the lobster, and the
hermit-crab&mdash;is so striking that naturalists have very
appropriately divided them into three sections, distinguished
by terms expressive of these peculiarities
of structure: 1st, <i>Brachyura</i>, or short-tailed decapods,
as the Crabs; 2d, <i>Anomoura</i>, or irregular tailed,
as the Hermit-crabs; 3d, <i>Macroura</i>, or long-tailed, as
Lobster, Cray-fish, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to a further consideration of a few familiar
examples of the first mentioned group that I propose
to devote the remainder of this chapter.</p>

<p>Few subjects of study are more difficult and obscure
than such as belong to the lower forms of the
animal kingdom. However carefully we may observe
the habits of these animals, our conclusions are too
often apt to be unsound, from our proneness to judge
of their actions as we would of the actions of men.
As a consequence, an animal may be pronounced at
one moment quiet and intelligent, and at another
obstinate and dull, while perhaps, if the truth were
known, it deserves neither verdict.</p>

<p>For my own part, the more I contemplate the
habits of many members of the marine animal kingdom,
the more am I astounded at the seeming intelligence
and purpose manifested in many of their
actions. Prior, apparently, must have been impressed
with the same idea, for he says, speaking of animals,&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">'Tis the fool's ignorance, and the pedant's pride!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This train of thought has been suggested to my
mind by viewing the singular conduct of a Shore-Crab,
whom I kept domesticated for many consecutive
months. Three times during his confinement he cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
his exuvium, and had become nearly double his original
size. His increased bulk made him rather unfit for my
small ocean in miniature, and gave him, as it were, a
loblolliboy appearance. Besides, he was always full of
mischief, and exhibited such pawkiness, that I often
wished he were back again to his sea-side home.
Whenever I dropped in a meal for my Blennies, he
would wait until I had retired, and then rush out,
disperse the fishes, and appropriate the booty to himself.
If at all possible, he would catch one of my
finny pets in his arms, and speedily devour it.
Several times he succeeded in so doing; and fearing
that the whole pack would speedily disappear, unless
stringent measures for their preservation were
adopted, I determined to eject the offender. After
considerable trouble, his crabship was captured, and
transferred to a capacious glass.</p>

<p>The new lodging, though not so large as the one
to which for so long a time he had been accustomed,
was nevertheless clean, neat, and well-aired. At its
base stood a fine piece of polished granite, to serve
as a chair of state, beneath which was spread a carpet
of rich green ulva. The water was clear as crystal;
in fact, the accommodation, as a whole, was unexceptionable.
The part of host I played myself,
permitting no one to usurp my prerogative. But in
spite of this, the crab from the first was extremely
dissatisfied and unhappy with the change, and for
hours together, day after day, he would make frantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and ineffectual attempts to climb up the smooth
walls of his dwelling-place. Twice a day, for a
week, I dropped in his food, consisting of half a
mussel, and left it under his very eyes; nay, I often
lifted him up and placed him upon the shell which
contained his once-loved meal; still, although the
latter presented a most inviting come-and-eat kind
of appearance, not one particle would he take, but
constantly preferred to raise himself as high as possible
up the sides of the vase, until losing his balance,
he as constantly toppled over and fell upon its base.</p>

<p>This behaviour not a little surprised me. Did it
indicate sullenness? or was it caused by disappointment?
Was he aware that escape from his prison
without aid was impossible, and consequently exhibited
the pantomime, which I have described, to express
his annoyance, and longing for the home he
had lately left?</p>

<p>Thinking that perhaps there was not sufficient
sea-weed in the glass, I added a small bunch of <i>I.
edulis</i>. Having thus contributed, as I believed, to
the comfort of the unhappy crab, I silently bade him
<i>bon soir</i>. On my return home, I was astonished by
the servant, who responded to my summons at the
door, blurting out in a nervous manner, 'O sir!
the creature's run awa!' 'The creature&mdash;what
creature?' I inquired. 'Do ye no ken, sir?&mdash;the wee
crabbie in the tumler!'</p>

<p>I could scarcely credit the evidence of my sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
when I saw the 'tumler' minus its crustaceous occupant.
The first thought that occurred to me was
as to where the crab could be found. Under chairs,
sofa, and fender, behind book-case, cabinet, and
piano, in every crevice, hole, and corner, for at least
an hour did I hunt without success. Eventually
the hiding-place of the fugitive was discovered in the
following singular manner: As I sat at my desk, I
was startled by a mysterious noise which apparently
proceeded from the interior of my 'Broadwood,'
which, by-the-by, I verily believe knows something
about the early editions of 'The battle of Prague,'
The strings of this venerable instrument descend
into ill-disguised cupboards, so that at the lower
part there are two doors, or, in scientific language,
'valves.' On opening one of these, what should
I see but the poor crab, who, at my approach,
'did' a kind of scamper polka over the strings.
This performance I took the liberty of cutting short
with all possible speed. On dragging away the performer,
I found that his appearance was by no means
improved since I saw him last. Instead of being
ornamented with gracefully-bending polypes, he was
coated, body and legs, with dust and cobwebs. I
determined to try the effect of a bath, and presently
had the satisfaction of seeing him regain his usual
comely appearance. The next step was to replace
him in his old abode; and having done so, I felt
anxious to know how the creature had managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
scale his prison walls. The <i>modus operandi</i> was
speedily made apparent; yet I feel certain that, unless
one had watched as I did, the struggles of this
little fellow, the determination and perseverance he
exhibited would be incredible.</p>

<p>After examining his movements for an hour, I
found, by dint of standing on the points of his toes,
poised on a segment of weed, that he managed to
touch the brim of the glass. Having got thus far,
he next gradually drew himself up, and sat upon the
edge of the vessel. In this position he would rest
as seemingly content as a bird on a bush, or a schoolboy
on a gate.</p>

<p>My curiosity satisfied, the <i>C. mænas</i> was again
placed in the vase, and every means of escape removed.</p>

<p>Here let me mention that I still had a Fiddler-Crab
in my large tank, who had formerly lived in
companionship with the shore-crab above mentioned.
With 'the fiddler' I had no fault to find; he was
always modest and gentle, and gave no offence whatever
to my Blennies. He never attempted to embrace
them, nor to usurp their lawful place at the
table, nor even to appropriate their meals. On the
contrary, he always crept under a stone, and closely
watched the process of eating until the coast was
clear, when he would scuttle out, and feed, Lazarus-like,
upon any crumbs that might be scattered around.</p>

<p>Although so modest and retiring, I soon discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that this little crab possessed an ambitious and roving
disposition. This made him wish to step into
the world without, and proceed on a voyage of discovery&mdash;to
start, indeed, on his own account, and be
independent of my hospitality, or the dubious bounty
of his finny companions. Taking advantage on
one occasion of a piece of sandstone that rested on
the side of the aquarium, he climbed up its slanting-side,
from thence he stepped on to the top of the
vessel, and so dropped down outside upon the room
floor. For nearly two days I missed his familiar face,
but had no conception that he had escaped, or that
he wished to escape from his crystal abode. It was
by mere accident that I discovered the fact.</p>

<p>Entering my study, after a walk on a wet day,
umbrella in hand, I thoughtlessly placed this useful
article against a chair. A little pool of water immediately
formed upon the carpet, which I had no
sooner noticed, than I got up to remove the <i>parapluie</i>
to its proper place in the stand, but started back in
surprise, for in the little pool stood the fugitive fiddler
moistening his branchiæ.</p>

<p>Taking up the little prodigal who had left my protection
so lately, I soon deposited him in a vase of
clear salt water. After a while, thinking it might
conduce to the happiness of both parties, I placed
him in companionship with his old friend, <i>Carcinus
mænas</i>. This, like many other philanthropic projects,
proved a complete failure. Both creatures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
once so harmless towards each other, seemed suddenly
inspired by the demon of mischief. Combats, more
or less severe, constantly occurring, in a few days I
separated them.</p>

<p>The 'fiddler' I placed in the large tank, where he
rested content, and never again offered to escape&mdash;evidently
the better of his experience. Not so his
old friend, who still continued obstinate and miserable
as ever. In his case I determined to see if a
certain amount of sternness would not curb his
haughty spirit. For two days I offered him no
food, but punished him with repeated strokes on his
back, morning and evening. This treatment was
evidently unpleasant, for he scampered about with
astonishing rapidity, and ever endeavoured to shelter
himself under the granite centre-piece. When I
thought he had been sufficiently chastised, I next
endeavoured to coax him into contentment and
better conduct. My good efforts were, however, unavailing.
Every morning I placed before him a
newly-opened mussel, but on no occasion did he
touch a morsel. All day he continued struggling,
as heretofore, to climb up the side of his chamber,
trying by every means in his power to escape.
This untameable disposition manifested itself for
about a week, but at the end of that time, on looking
into the vase, I saw the crab seated on the top
of the stone, his body resting against the glass. I
then took up a piece of meat and placed it before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
him. To my surprise he did not run away as usual.
Having waited for some minutes, and looking upon
his obstinacy as unpardonable, I tapped him with a
little stick&mdash;still he never moved. A sudden thought
flashed across my mind; I took him up in my hand,
examined him, and quickly found that he was stiff
and dead!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a little crab, <i>Porcellana longicornis</i>, or
Minute Porcelain-Crab, frequently to be met with
in certain localities.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of this creature is the thickness
and the great disproportionate length of his arms,
as compared with the size of his pea-like body. He
possesses a singular habit which I have not observed
in any other crustaceans. He does not sit under a
stone, for instance, but always lies beneath such object
with his back upon the ground; so that when a
boulder is turned over, these crabs are always found
sitting upon it, whereas the shore-crabs, when the
light of day is suddenly let in upon them, scamper
off with all possible speed; or if any remain, it appears
as if they had been pressed to death almost,
by the weight of the stone upon their backs.</p>

<p>The colour of <i>P. longicornis</i> is that of prepared
chocolate, shaded off to a warm red.</p>

<p>Another crab, equally common with those already
mentioned, is to be met with when dredging, and in
most rock-pools.  At Wardie, near Edinburgh, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
have seen hundreds of all sizes hiding beneath the
rocks at low tide. Its scientific name is <i>Hyas araneus</i>,
but it is better known as one of the Spider-Crabs.
It claims close relationship with that noted crustaceous
sanitory reformer, <i>Maia squinado</i>. Although this
H. araneus is a somewhat pleasant fellow when you
get thoroughly acquainted with his eccentricities, appearances
are sadly against him at starting. Speaking
with due caution and in the gentlest manner
possible, consistent with truth, I must say that this
crab is, without exception, one of the dirtiest-looking
animals I have ever met with in my zoological
researches. At a by no means hasty glance, he appears
to be miraculously built up of mud, hair, and
grit on every part, except his claws, which are long
and sharp as those of any bird of prey.</p>

<p>The first specimen I ever saw, seemed as if he had
been dipped in a gum pot, and then soused over
head and ears in short-cut hair and filth.</p>

<p>The second specimen, although equally grimy, had
some redeeming points in his personal appearance,
for at intervals every part of his back and claws
were covered with small frondlets of ulva, dulse,
<i>D. sanguinea</i>, and other beautiful weeds, all of
which were in a healthy condition. After keeping
him in a vase for a week, he managed, much against
my wish, to strip himself of the greater part of these
novel excrescences.</p>

<p>Instead of minute algæ, we read that these crabs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
are sometimes found with oysters (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>) attached
to their backs. Mr. W. Thompson mentions
two instances where this occurs, with specimens of <i>H.
araneus</i>, to be seen in Mr. Wyndman's cabinet.
Speaking of these, he adds, 'The oyster on the large
crab is three inches in length, and five or six years'
old, and is covered with many large Balani. The
shell, a carapace of the crab, is but two inches and a
quarter in length, and hence it must, Atlas-like, have
born a world of weight upon its shoulders. The presence
of the oyster affords interesting evidence that
the Hyas lived several years after attaining its full
growth.</p>

<p>For days after I had brought him home, my
second specimen appeared as if he were dead, and it
was only by examining his mouth through a hand
lens that I could satisfy myself as to his being
alive. When I pushed him about with an ivory
stick he never resisted, but always remained still
upon the spot where I had urged him.</p>

<p>This species of <i>acting</i> he has given up for some
time, and at the present moment I rank H. araneus
among my list of marine pets, for he does not appear
any longer to pine for mud with which to decorate
his person, but is quite content to 'purge and live
cleanly' all the rest of his days.</p>

<p>The ancients imagined that <i>Maia squinado</i> possessed
a great degree of wisdom, and further believed
him to be sensible to the divine charms of music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
It is very curious, as well as true, that this animal
has in a far higher degree than other crustaceans, a
gravity of demeanour, and a profound style of doing
everything, that always excites our irreverent laughter,
but at the same time leaves an impression that, if
justice were done, the animal ought to hold a higher
position in the marine world than a scavenger and
devourer of ocean garbage. If <i>Maia</i> and <i>C. mænas</i>
be both eating out of the same dish, in the shape of
an open mussel, the former seems ever inclined to
admonish his companion upon greediness and want
of manners. The only seeming reason why <i>M. squinado</i>
does not really give such advice, is because
of the impossibility of any individual speaking
with his mouth full. The knowledge, too, that if
he commenced a pantomimic discourse, it would give
his young friend an opportunity of gaining too large
a share of the banquet, may, perhaps, have something
to do with his preferring to remain quiet.</p>

<p>As for <i>Maia's</i> possession of appreciative musical
qualities, I can only state that both he and his friend
<i>Hyas</i> really do convey to the beholder an impression
confirmatory of this statement. I have frequently
been amused to observe the singular phenomenon of
each animal coming to the side of the vase and rocking
his body to and fro, in apparent delight at the
exercise of my vocal abilities, just as when a pleasing
melody is being played in the concert room, we bend
backwards and forwards, and beat time to the tune.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
These animals also adopt the same course: it must
be to unheard music (which the poets say is sweetest),
that seems ever and anon to fall on their ears, giving
them great delight.</p>

<p>The movements here alluded to may be in no
way influenced by music; but such as they are, it
is curious that they have not been noticed as an apparent
explanation of the origin of the ancient belief
regarding the Spider-Crabs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A friend, on one occasion having procured for me,
among other objects, a Common Limpet, I placed
this mollusc in my aquarium, and soon had the
pleasure of watching it affix its broad foot to the
surface of the glass. After a while, on the Limpet
slightly raising its canopy, I was surprised to observe
a little Shore-Crab peer out from between the foot
and shell. On suddenly ejecting the intruder by
means of a small brush, he speedily hid himself from
view among the surrounding pebbles. A few hours
after, on again approaching the tank to view the
Patella (which was easily identified, from the fact
of an immense colony of Mussels being settled on its
back), I found to my great astonishment that the
crab had re-seated himself in his old position. I
often repeated the sweeping operation, but without
success, for the little rascal had become artful, and
was not inclined to be driven forth a second time by
a <i>coup de main</i>. I touched the Limpet frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and saw it glue itself, as usual, to the glass; but,
singular to state, the creature always left a larger space
between its foot and the circumference of the shell on
the side at which the crab was seated, than on the
opposite one, seemingly from a wish to accommodate
its crustaceous friend. This space, moreover, let me
observe, was larger than was absolutely necessary,
for, as the shell was not air-tight, I was enabled to
thrust my camel-hair pencil teazingly upon the crab,
and was much amused to watch him clutch at the
intruding object, and, at times, move about with it
in his grasp, thus proving that he was by no means
uncomfortably 'cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd.'</p>

<p>For a whole week the crab remained in his favorite
lodgings, and only resigned occupancy thereof
when his friend gave up the shell&mdash;and died.</p>

<p>There is a certain species of crab, <i>Pinnotheres
pisum</i>, or common Pea-Crab, frequently found in
<i>Mytilus edulis</i>, the Oyster, and the Common Cockle.
Indeed, one gentleman states, that on his examining,
on two occasions, a large number of specimens of the
<i>Cardium edule</i>, he found that nine out of every ten
cockles contained a crab. Still, in no other instance
than the one my own experience furnishes, have I
ever heard of the Shore-Crab, or, indeed, of any other
crustacean, becoming the guest of <i>Patella</i>.</p>

<p>The classical reader will not fail to remember
Pliny's statement (somewhat analogous to that above
narrated) of a small crab, <i>Pinnotheres veterum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
which is always found to inhabit the Pinna,&mdash;a large
species of mussel. This latter animal being blind,
but muscularly strong, and its juvenile companion
quick-sighted, but weak of limb, the crab, it is said,
always keeps a sharp look-out, and when any danger
approaches, he gladly creeps into the gaping shell for
protection. Some writers assert, that when the
bivalve has occasion to eat, he sends forth his faithful
henchman to procure food. If any foe approaches,
<i>Pinnotheres</i> flies for protection with his utmost speed
to the anxious bosom of his friend, who, being thus
warned of danger, closes his valves, and escapes the
threatened attack. When, on the contrary, the crab
loads himself with booty, he makes a gentle noise at
the opening of the shell, which is closed during his
absence, and on admission, this curious pair fraternize,
and feast on the fruits of the little one's foray.</p>

<p>For those of my readers who may prefer verse to
prose, I here append a poetical version of this fable&mdash;equally
pretty, but, let me add in a whisper, equally
opposed to fact, at least in its principal details:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>There is one singular feature in the Crustacea
which it may prove interesting to dwell a little
upon. I allude to their power of living apparently
without food, or at least without any other sustenance
than is afforded by the animalculæ contained
in the water in which they dwell. One accurate
observer states that he kept a Cray-fish for a
period of two years, during which time the only
food the animal received was a few worms,&mdash;not
more than fifty altogether. This statement I have
often had ample means of verifying. Yet, on the
other hand, strange to say, the crab is always on
the hunt after tit-bits; and nothing seems to give
him greater delight than a good morning meal, in
the shape of a newly opened Mussel, Cockle, and
above all&mdash;a Pholas. Let a youthful crustacean
cast its shell, and rest assured, unless its companions
have had their appetites appeased, they will endeavour
to fall upon and devour the defenceless animal.
This, to my chagrin and annoyance, I have known
to occur repeatedly. When nothing else can be
procured, not only the Lobster Crabs, but any
Brachyurous Decapods who may be at hand, will set
to work, and industriously pick off and eat the Acorn-Barnacles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
attached to any object within reach.
These facts show that the asceticism of the crab is
not voluntary, and that when opportunity occurs, he
is as fond of a good dinner as are animals possessed
of a higher degree of organization.</p>

<p>It will be gratifying if other observers are able to
verify the circumstance which I shall allude to hereafter,
and which would seem to show that the
<i>exuviation</i> of crustacea is expedited by affording
specimens an unlimited supply of food.</p>

<p>'The organs for pursuing, seizing, tearing, and
comminuting the food of the Brachyurous Decapods,'
says Professor Bell, 'are carried to a high degree of
development; ... these appendages consist of six
pairs, of which some are actual organs of mastication,
as the mandibles or the true jaws, the foot jaws or
pedipalps, generally serving to keep the food in contact
with the former, whilst it is being broken up
by them.</p>

<p>'The buccal orifice in the Brachyura occupies the
interior face of the cephalic division of the body, and
is bounded anteriorly by a crustaceous lamina of
determinate form, which has been termed the upper
lip, and posteriorly by another, termed the lower lip.
The mandibles occupy the sides of the opening.
After these, and external to them, are the first, and
then the second pair of true jaws, followed by the
three pairs of pedipalps or foot jaws, the last of
which, when at rest, close the mouth, and include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the whole of the preceding ones. In the Macroura
the pedipalps are very different in their forms, and
have the aspect of very simple feet.</p>

<p>'The means of comminuting the food are not restricted
to the complicated machinery above referred
to, for the stomach itself contains a very remarkable
apparatus, consisting of several hard calcareous pieces,
which may be termed <i>gastric teeth</i>. They are attached
to horny or calcareous levers, fixed in the parietes of
the stomach; they are moved by a complicated
system of muscles, and are admirably adapted to
complete the thorough breaking-down of the aliment,
which had already been to a considerable extent
affected by the buccal appendages. These gastric
teeth may be readily seen and examined in the larger
species of Decapoda, as in the large eatable crab and
the lobster; and it will be readily perceived how
perfectly the different pieces are made to act upon
each other, and to grind the food interposed between
them.'</p>

<p>Having been on a certain day at the sea-side collecting,
I was amused to observe the movements of
two ragged little urchins, who approached near to
where I stood, bottle in hand, examining some
beautiful zoophytes by aid of a pocket lens. One
of them had a short iron rod, with which he very
dexterously hooked out any unfortunate crab who
happened to have taken up its quarters in some
crevice or beneath a boulder.  Having captured a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
specimen, it was handed over to his companion, who
quickly tied it to a string which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>I had seen many a rope of onions, but this was
the first time I had seen a rope of crabs. On inquiry,
I learned that the boys had taken two dozen
animals in about two hours. When any of the
green-bellied crabs happened to be poked out, they
were allowed to escape back again as quickly as
they pleased.</p>

<p>With poor <i>Cancer pagurus</i> the case was different,&mdash;every
specimen, as soon as caught, being strung up,
and doomed to 'death in the pot.'</p>

<p>The above, I need scarcely state, is not the usual
manner of fishing for crabs, the approved plan being
to take them in what are termed crab-pots, 'a sort
of wicker-trap made, by preference, of the twigs of
the golden willow (<i>salex vitellina</i>), at least in many
parts of the coast, on account, as they say, of its
great durability and toughness. These pots are
formed on the principle of a common wire mousetrap,
but with the entrance at the top; they are
baited with pieces of fish, generally of some otherwise
useless kind, and these are fixed into the pots
by means of a skewer. The pots are sunk by stones
attached to the bottom, and the situation where
they are dropped is indicated, and the means of raising
them provided, by a long line fixed to the creel,
or pot, having a piece of cork attached to the free
end of the line; these float the line, and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
time serve to designate the owners of the different
pots&mdash;one, perhaps, having three corks near together
towards the extremity of the line, and two distant
ones&mdash;another may have one cork fastened crosswise,
another fastened together, and so on. It is, of
course, for their mutual security that the fishermen
abstain from poaching on their neighbour's property;
and hence we find that stealing from each other's
pots is a crime almost wholly unknown amongst
them.'</p>

<p>'The fishery for these crabs constitutes an important
trade on many parts of the coast. The
numbers which are annually taken are immense; and,
as the occupation of procuring them is principally
carried on by persons who are past the more laborious
and dangerous pursuits of general fishing, it
affords a means of subsistence to many a poor man
who, from age or infirmity, would be unable without
it to keep himself and his family from the workhouse.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twice</span> in every twenty-four hours the waters of the
ocean ebb and flow. Twice only in each month,
however, do the spring-tides occur. For there are
few dangers that the ardent student of nature
would not encounter. Lord Bacon tells of a certain
bishop who used to bathe regularly twice every
day, and on being asked why he bathed thus often,
answered, 'Because I cannot conveniently bathe
<i>three</i> times.' The zoologist, like the 'right reverend
father' alluded to, would willingly undergo what
appears to others much hardship and trouble, not
only once or twice, but even three times daily, in
pursuit of his favourite studies, did Nature but offer
the kind convenience.</p>

<p>On these occasions the zoologist can pursue his researches
at the shore, at a distance beyond the usual
tidal line. Numerous boulders and rock-pools, during
many days covered by the sea, being then laid bare
and exposed to his eager, searching hands and eyes,
he is frequently able to discover many rare objects, or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
at least, common ones revelling in almost giant-like
proportions, and wonderful profusion.</p>

<p>The Soldier or Hermit-Crabs (to an account of
whom we intend to devote this chapter), offer a most
remarkable proof of this. Occupying the centre of a
rocky excavation, I have repeatedly found several dozen
of these comical creatures, each inhabiting the cast-off
shell of a defunct Whelk (<i>Buccinum undatum</i>),
which measured not less than five or six inches in
length. To my surprise these aldermanic crustaceans
possessed no companions of a smaller growth; while
at a few yards nearer shore, as many shells would be
found congregated together as in the more distant
pool,&mdash;the largest, however, being no bigger than a
damson, while the smallest might be compared to an
infantile pea, or cherry-stone.</p>

<p>I cannot explain this appearance otherwise, than
by supposing that the <i>Anomoura</i> become prouder,
or, it may be, more cunning, as they grow older, and,
having arrived at their full development, they fit
themselves with their final suit; thereafter, in a
spirit of aristocratic exclusiveness, they retire to
fashionable subaqueous residences, distant as far as
possible from the homes of the <i>canaille</i>, who inhabit
the common, littoral boundaries of the shore.</p>

<p>The peculiarity, to which I alluded, of the
<i>Anomoura</i> occupying shells that have formerly
belonged to other animals, is so strange that some
writers have not hesitated to express doubt upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the subject. This denial of a fact, which can so
readily be proved, is one of the 'curiosities of literature.'
Swammerdam, a Dutch naturalist contemptuously
observes, 'What an idle fable that is which is
established even among those who study shell-fishes,
when they show some kind of the crab kind in their
museums, adding at the same time, that they pass
from one shell to another, devour the animals that
lived in those shells, and keep them for their own
habitations. They dignify them with the high-sounding
names, and additions, as Soldiers, Hermits, and
the like; and thus, having no experience, they commit
gross errors, and deceive themselves, as well as
others, with their idle imaginations.'</p>

<p>That there is nothing mythical in the matter can
easily be made apparent to any person who chooses
to visit the sea-shore. At such locality he need have
no difficulty in recognising the Hermit-Crab, or
meeting with numerous specimens for examination.
Supposing such a one is at a rock-pool, and, moreover,
that he knows by sight the Buckie (periwinkle),
and Common Whelk, he will probably in such case
be aware that the animals occupying these shells are
snail-like in construction, and that their locomotion
is consequently slow and formal. If, therefore,
when peering into any pool he sees the Buckie, for
instance, apparently change its nature, and instead of</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
'Dragging its slow length along,'</p>

<p>scamper off suddenly, or roll over and over from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
top of an eminence to the bottom, he may rest assured
that the original inhabitant has departed, and
that its place is occupied by a Lobster-Crab.</p>

<p>The cause of his strange peculiarity I will briefly
explain.</p>

<p>In the true Lobster the tail forms a most valuable
appendage. In the tail the principal muscular
power of the animal is seated; and by means of it,
too, the animal is enabled to spring to a considerable
distance, and also to swim through the water at
will. This important organ is well protected by a
casing consisting of a 'series of calcareous rings,
forming a hard and insensible chain armour.'</p>

<p>In the Lobster-Crab there is no such arrangement.
'The abdominal segment of this singular
animal, instead of possessing the same crustaceous
covering as the rest of his body and claws, is quite
soft, <i>and merely enveloped in a thin skin</i>. To protect
this delicate member from the attacks of his
voracious companions, the poor Pagurus is compelled
to hunt about for some Univalve, such as a Whelk
or Trochus, and having found this, he drops his tail
within the aperture and hooks it firmly to the columella
of the shell. Why Providence has doomed the
poor Hermits to descend to such physical hypocrisy,
and clothe themselves in the left-off garments of
other animals, it is not easy to conjecture. No doubt,
besides the defence of their otherwise unprotected
bodies, he has some other object of importance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
view. Perhaps they may accelerate the decomposition
of the shells they inhabit, and cause them sooner
to give way to the action of the atmosphere; and as
all exuviæ may be termed nuisances and deformities,
giving to these deserted mansions an appearance
of renewed life and locomotion, removes them in
some sort from the catalogue of blemishes.'</p>

<p>Professor Jones, when treating of this class of
animals, forcibly remarks that 'the wonderful adaptation
of all the limbs to a residence in such a dwelling,
cannot fail to strike the most curious observer.
The <i>Chelæ</i>, or large claws, differ remarkably in size,
so that when the animal retires into its concealment,
the smaller one may be entirely withdrawn, while
the larger closes and guards the orifice. The two
succeeding pairs of legs, unlike those of the Lobster,
are of great size and strength, and instead of being
terminated by pincers, end in strong-pointed levers,
whereby the animal can not only crawl, but drag after
it, its heavy habitation. Behind these locomotive
legs are two feeble pairs, barely strong enough to
enable the Soldier-Crab to shift his position in the
shell he has chosen; and the false feet attached to
the abdomen are even still more rudimentary in their
development. But the most singularly altered
portion of the skeleton is the fin of the tail, which
here becomes transformed into a kind of holding apparatus
by which the creature retains a firm grasp of
the bottom of his residence.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>So great is the power of the animals to retain
hold of their shell, and so intense their dislike to be
forcibly ejected therefrom, that they will often allow
their bodies to be pulled asunder, and sacrifice their
life rather than submit to such indignity. This fact
I have proved on sundry occasions. But supposing
a crab to have taken a fancy to a shell, occupied by
some brother Pagurus, (a circumstance of frequent
occurrence), he quickly proceeds to dislodge the
latter. Curious to state, this process never seems
attended with any fatal result.</p>

<p>When watching the operation, it has appeared to
me as if the crab attacked preferred to yield rather
than be subjected to continuous annoyance, and the
discomfort of keeping for so long a time buried
within the inner recesses of his dwelling.</p>

<p>The contrast in appearance of the Hermit-Crab
when seated in his shell, and crawling about minus
such appendage, is great indeed.</p>

<p>This the reader will readily perceive by examining
the Illustrations on <a href="#Illus5">Plate 4</a>, which are drawn from
nature, and are truthful portraitures of this singular
creature.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the extreme difficulty
there is in expelling a Lobster-Crab. This, be it
understood, applies only to the animal in good
health; for no sooner does he feel sick than he instantly
leaves his shell, and crawls about in a most
pitiable plight. He sometimes becomes convalescent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
again by being placed solus in some fresh water, or
laid out in the air for a few moments. But he
ought, on no account, when in a sickly condition,
to be allowed to hide himself beneath any pieces of
rock or shadow of the Algæ.</p>

<p>If he is out of sight, be sure not to let him
be out of mind; for, should he die in the tank,
and his body be allowed to remain for any length
of time, he will very soon afford you full proof
that such toleration on your part is anything but
pleasant.</p>

<p>Although, as already stated, this animal cannot
be drawn out of his shell except by extreme force,
the object can easily be obtained by aid of strategy.
Having been for some time at a loss how to give
certain young visitors a sight of the Hermit-Crab
in his defenceless state, I, by accident, hit upon the
following simple plan:&mdash;</p>

<p>With a piece of bent whalebone I lifted up a
Pagurus, shell and all, and allowed the latter to
drop upon the outer row of the tentacula of an
Actinia, which quickly stuck fast to the intruding
object. The crab at first did not seem fully alive
to his critical position. He popped out of his shell
and looked unsuspectingly around, until catching
sight of my face, he instantly retired from view
with a casket-like snap. In a minute he was out
again, and this time prepared to change his position.
For this purpose he gave several successive pulls, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
finding all his efforts to remove his carriage unavailing,
he unhooked his tail and scrambled down among
the pebbles. My purpose was thereby gained, for
the next moment he was resting in the palm of one
of my juvenile friends, who seemed quite delighted
with his prize. Twice afterwards, being in a mischievous
mood, I gave the crab a fright in the way
just mentioned; but it was quite evident, that what
might be sport to me was death to him, for he was
both annoyed and alarmed at my procedure. Even
when guiltless of any intention of touching the
creature, if I merely showed him the cane he
immediately hobbled away at the utmost rate of
speed he could muster. On several occasions I followed
after and brought him back to the edge of the
tank, although such conduct met with his strongest
disapproval, and caused him for some time to sulk
beneath an arch-way of rock work, away from the
reach of vulgar eyes.</p>

<p>Upon the side and near the base of my tank a fine
specimen of the Limpet was at one time attached.
From the centre of its shell a forest of sea-grass
waved gracefully, shadowing a large colony of Barnacles
thickly clustered beneath. Soon the Patella
decided upon taking its usual morning stroll in
search of food, a task of little difficulty, standing as
the animal already did upon the margin of a broad
meadow, richly coated with a verdant growth, composed
of the infant spores of the Ulva.  Slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
moving along, the Patella, with its riband-like band
of teeth, swept off the luscious weed in a series of
graceful curves, thus making an abundant and
healthful meal. Before proceeding far, however, he
was forced to bear the weight of a Soldier-Crab, who
had most unceremoniously climbed upon his back,
and taken up a position at the base of the <i>latissima</i>
fronds.</p>

<p>There seemed so much nonchalance about the
Pagurus that I determined to watch his movements,
and, if possible, to see how he would manage to
descend from a position which, if the mollusc continued
his mowing operations, would soon be unenviably
high.</p>

<p>In about an hour the Limpet had reached the
level of the water in the aquarium, and there took
up his abode for the night. Next day and the next
there was no change of situation. The crab now
began evidently to perceive the danger of the position
in which he was placed, for he constantly moved
to and fro, and peered over into what must have
seemed to him an unfathomable abyss.</p>

<p>While I stood, the Patella made a sudden movement
of its shell&mdash;so sudden, indeed, as to startle
its companion, who quickly put out his claws to save
himself from falling. Unfortunately, in his spasmodic
gesture he allowed the tip of one of his claws
to intrude under the edge of the conical canopy, thus,
in fact, pricking the fleshy 'mantle' of the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
within, who instantly, of course, glued itself to the
glass with immoveable firmness. I suppose the
same thing must have frequently occurred without
my knowledge, for after a lapse of several days the
Pagurus and his bearer were still in the same spot. I
felt a growing alarm for the continued health of the
Hermit-Crab, from the fact of its being poised so
directly over the ever-expanded tentacles of a large
Anemone. To prevent any mishap, I went to lift
his crabship, with a view of transferring him to a
place of safety, when, no sooner did he perceive the
advancing forceps, than he rushed into his shell with
a sudden and audible 'click,' forgetting for the moment
that he stood on such ticklish ground. The consequence
was that, seeking to avoid Scylla, he fell into
Charybdis. In other words, he dropped plump upon
the well-gummed tenter-hooks of the Crassicornis,
which instantly closed and engulphed its prize. In
vain did I endeavour with all speed to pick out the
devoted Pagurus. The more I tried, the more firmly
did the Actinia hold him in its convulsive grasp.</p>

<p>With extremely few exceptions, the Hermit-Crabs
are always found to be a prying, prowling, curious
class of animals, and are ever, like the husband of the
fair Lady Jane&mdash;</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
'Poking their nose (?) into this thing and that.'</p>

<p>They will turn over each shell and pebble that comes
in their way, and examine it with profound attention,
or industriously climb up and roll down hillocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and trees in the shape of small rocks and sea-weeds,
much to their danger.</p>

<p>I once possessed a Hermit-Crab, whose voracious
movements afforded considerable amusement to myself
and my friends. My Diogenes&mdash;or, as the
Cockney news-boys used to pronounce the now
extinct comic periodical, <i>Dodgenes</i>&mdash;on a certain occasion
had climbed up a segmentally cut frond of
Irish Moss. On reaching the topmost point, his
weight became too great for the weed to bear; so,
finding he was losing his equilibrium, in great
alarm he made a clutch at the first object that stood
near, in order to save him from falling.</p>

<p>A mussel was moored hard by, to the side of the
vase by means of its silken byssus threads, and upon
this friendly bivalve the Pagurus leaped by aid of his
long taper legs. Unluckily the shell of the Mytilus
was open, and the crab unwittingly thrusting his toe
within the aperture, the intruding object was of
course instantly gripped by the mollusc. This accident
put him in a terrible fright. His gestures
were most excited, and no wonder. Let the reader
fancy himself hanging on to a window sill, at a height
say of twenty feet from the ground, with the sash-frame
fixed on his hand, and a huge iron foot-bath,
or some such object, attached to the lower part of
his body, and he will have a tolerably correct idea of
the painful position of our crustacean friend.</p>

<p>After curling and uncurling his tail, and trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
several times in vain to throw his tub upon the valve
of the mussel, he released hold of his encumbrance,
and allowed it to drop. Although still hanging, he
had no difficulty in rolling up his 'continuation,' and
elevating his body to the walls of his prison. Once
again upon solid ground, he laboured hard to get his
leg free. But unsuccessful in his efforts, he adopted
another course, and snapped it off in a rage.</p>

<p>Scarcely, however, was the act of mutilation
finished, when the stupid animal apparently seemed
anxious to recover his lost toe, (which I may
mention, had in reality fallen down among the
pebbles).</p>

<p>After scraping, then resting, and scraping again,
many successive times, he at last succeeded in diving
the points of his largest claw into the chasm formed
by the gaping mollusc. Of course, the member was
held as if by a powerful vice. Very soon his courage
deserted him, and he seemed to wait and weep
despairingly for fate to release him from the sad
predicament into which he had foolishly fallen. Alas!
he little knew the singular part that fickle fortune
had doomed him to play,&mdash;to become, if I may so
term it, a kind of Prometheus in the tank.</p>

<p>My pack of fishes, having been on short rations
for several days, had become exceedingly ravenous,
and consequently were keeping a sharp look-out
for scraps. Hence their intense delight on catching
sight of the devoted 'Dodgenes' can readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
be imagined.  Such a delicious <i>morceau</i> was perfectly
irresistible:&mdash;</p>

<p>At it they went, 'tooth and nail,' First one and
then another tore away a mouthful, until in the
twinkling of an eye, almost, the martyr crab was left
forlorn and dead&mdash;</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
'A remnant of his former self.'</p>

<p>During the early portion of last year I had a Hermit-Crab
inhabiting a pretty Purpura, whose shell I
wished to sketch as an illustration, it being of
peculiar form and colour. On going to the tank I
discovered that Pagurus had most apropos vacated
his turbinated cot, apparently in consequence of his
feeling rather squeamish. Thinking he might perhaps
presently recover, or pick up another dwelling,
I hesitated not to abstract the shell, in order to
make the required drawing. I had not been occupied
with my task for more than five minutes, when
my attention was attracted by a great excitement
and clatter pervading the tank. A hasty glance
within the vessel sufficed to explain the cause of the
hubbub.</p>

<p>The brief domestic drama of which I was a
spectator, with its somewhat singular denouement,
I will now proceed to unfold for the reader's entertainment.
It conveys a good lesson in natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
history, and also exhibits a striking example of life
beneath the waters.</p>

<p>The Blennies, I may state, had become very voracious,
pugnacious, and audacious; nothing seemed
safe from their attacks. I had begun to feed them
on the <i>Cardium edule</i> and Mussel, but such diet,
after a time, only served to whet their appetite,
which certainly appeared to 'grow by what it fed
on,' for they darted about through the water in
all directions, searching, as I suppose, for other
dainties. These efforts were unsuccessful, until
they caught sight of the plump, undefended
portion of the body of their companion, the
Hermit-Crab, who had just left his shell, as above
stated.</p>

<p>The sight of such a feast must have (figuratively
speaking) made their 'mouths water,' One after
another these rascally fish dodged round the crustaceous
victim, and gripped, and shook his 'continuation'
with extraordinary violence. In vain did the
crab try to act on the defensive; all his efforts to
retaliate were ineffectual, and in this instance it
might be truly said that 'might' overcame 'right.'
He ran to and fro in great distress, scraping the
pebbles and shells about (thus partly creating the
clatter that I had heard while sketching), in the
hope that he might find an empty univalve in
which to deposit his mutilated carcase. When
almost breathless and exhausted, he discovered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
worn-out Wentletrap, and strove to lift his quivering
body into the aperture, alas! without success. His
strength failed him, and he fell dead at the very
threshold of his new-found home.</p>

<p>While watching thus far the above transaction,
the writer felt almost inclined to waver in the faith
he had long held with others, namely, that fishes and
other marine animals are insensible to pain. But the
movements of this poor Hermit-Crab were as indicative
of severe suffering as anything he ever witnessed
in bird or quadruped.</p>

<p>Wishing to examine the remains of the crab, I
stepped aside for a few moments to procure my
forceps, but when I again reached the vase, to my
intense surprise the defunct animal was nowhere to
be seen! I could only account for so singular a
circumstance by supposing some of the larger crustaceans
had taken advantage of my absence to complete
the work of destruction, and therefore took no
further notice of the matter at the time.</p>

<p>I had often wished that some of my finny pets
would deposit their spawn in the tank, and felt very
anxious, if such an event did take place, that I might
be near to witness it. But I was most anxious to
watch the gradual development of the ova, and, if
practicable, to become the fond owner of a host of
infant 'fishlings.'</p>

<p>Guess the thrill of pride, then, which ran through
my veins when, on peering into my mimic rock-pool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
after a brief absence from home, I observed the
largest of my Blennies to be apparently in an 'interesting
condition.' I watched and petted her many
times daily, and fed her with every suitable dainty
that could be thought of. Sometimes I took her
in the palm of my hand, and with a fine camel-hair
pencil stroked her glossy back. This operation
evidently gave great delight to the little beauty; and
after a while, when my hand was laid in the water,
she gently floated off into her native element with
almost swan-like grace.</p>

<p>The law of nature being the same with this fish
as with the Stickleback, I knew the nest, if there
was to be one at all, should be built by the male.
But as I could not detect any specimen of the
'sterner sex' among my pack, and there being
no signs of preparation for the grand event about to
take place, I felt in a manner compelled to carry
out the nidifying task in my own humble way. Of
course, I gave up all idea of 'weaving' a nest with
bits of weed, stones, and marine glue; nor was such
a style of structure a desideratum in the present
instance, wanting, as I did, to take notes, in Paul
Pry fashion, of the minutest particular that might
occur within the building. The following was the
plan I adopted. First was procured the exquisitely
formed valve of a large <i>Pecten</i>, the interior of
which was white and beautifully irridescent. This
pretty cot, I said to myself, shall serve as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
chamber for my <i>protégé</i>. The shell being deposited
behind a piece of rock, in such a position that its
side rested against the surface of the glass, I was
thus enabled to watch what was going on within.
Some fronds of sea-weed were trained around so as
to form a kind of drapery. The Blenny, I am quite
certain, knew perfectly well that all this care and
preparation was on her account, for nearly the whole
of each day she spent in the novel apartment extemporized
for her accommodation. After a week had
elapsed, she grew uneasy and pettish, was ever
snapping at her companions, and hunting them
about in all directions. On one occasion, however,
she seemed to be uneasy, now clashing round the
rock, then darting to the top of the tank, and down
again upon the pebbles. Scores of times these
movements were repeated, until I felt alarmed for
her safety, and annoyed at my inability to relieve
her sufferings. But aid from me being impossible,
I felt compelled, though very unwillingly, to allow
nature to take its course.</p>

<p>On looking into the aquarium one morning, I
observed some strange object protruding from the
fish. The little creature, too, on catching sight of
me, came to the side of the tank, near to where I
stood, and by her movements asked me, as plainly
as any dumb animal could ask, to give her my
assistance. After a few minutes spent in a 'brown
study', I resolved to grant her petition, and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
setting to work, drew from her&mdash;what?
what do you suppose, reader? In truth neither
more nor less than the body, head, and long antennæ
of the 'martyr' Hermit-Crab! whose late sudden
disappearance was now fully accounted for.</p>

<p>There are ten British species of Lobster-Crab, but
one only, <i>P. Bernardhus</i>, to which the reader has
been introduced, is common to our shores.</p>

<h2>VI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Armory of the Tower of London forms, it is
generally admitted, one of the most interesting sights
of the great metropolis. No one can look without
wonder upon that goodly array of knights and noble
warriors, nor help an involuntary sigh over the degeneracy
of modern humanity. Though the figures
before us are technically and irreverently termed
'dummies,' the hardened shell with which their body
and limbs are cased we know has felt the throb of
many a true English heart, maybe, glistened beneath
the sun at Cressy and Agincourt, or perhaps on
the bloody fields of Worcester and Marston Moor.
It requires no great power of the imagination to
transport ourselves to bygone centuries, and listen
to the ring of hostile arms, the sepulchral voices of
men whose heads are inurned in casques of steel,
blended with the clash of battle-axes, the whizz of
arrows, the neighing of steeds, the rattle of
musketry, and at intervals the deep booming
cannon's roar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>But, asks the gasping reader, what has this parade
of mail-clad warriors and old battle-fields to do with
so prosaic a theme as the exuviation of crabs? I
must acknowledge that the question is a very natural
one, for there appears at first sight no connection
between the two subjects. The analogy will
not, I believe, appear so forced when I mention my
possession of a smaller, although hardly less singular
armory, consisting of various coats of shelly mail,
each of which, at one time or other, belonged to,
and was worn by a living creature, and proved as
effectual a protection in many fierce though bloodless
combats as any casque or helmet worn by knight.
Unlike the dummies of the Tower, my specimens are
perfect, and give a complete representation, more
truthful than any photograph, of the defunct originals,
when armed by Nature <i>cap-a-pie</i>.</p>

<p>In plain words, I own a curious collection of the
cast-off shells of various crabs, which have from time
to time been under my protection. From the fact
that no museum in the kingdom contains a single
<i>series</i> of such objects, exhibiting the various stages
of growth in any crustaceous animal, the reader will
easily conceive the difficulty there must be in procuring
them, and consequently the interest that
attaches to the mysterious phenomenon of exuviation.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the subject of this chapter is one
of the least known in the whole range of natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
history. The facts connected with the process are
few, and far from well authenticated. This state
of things appears the more extraordinary, when we
remember the great facility with which specimens of
crustacea may be found.</p>

<p>For years past I have paid much attention to
the elucidation of this subject, and during that period
have had to submit to numberless mishaps and
disappointments. For example, perhaps after watching
a 'pet' day after day for months, anxiously
expecting that exuviation would take place, in nine
cases out of ten,&mdash;ay, in ninety-nine out of the
hundred,&mdash;I would find that the process had been
completed when I was asleep, or that the animal
had died suddenly. In the latter case new specimens
had to be procured, and the same watching process
repeated, in most cases with the like unhappy results.</p>

<p>I will now, however, endeavour as briefly as possible
to make the reader acquainted with what has
already been written upon exuviation, as far as I
have been able to learn, up to the present time,
interspersing the narrative with such notes as may
seem necessary by way of illustration, and then proceed,
in the words of Shakspeare, to lay down my
own 'penny of observation.'</p>

<p>The first clear and satisfactory remarks on this
subject were made by the celebrated Reaumur, who
lived above a century ago: 'The unexampled accuracy
and truthfulness of this great naturalist is attested,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
says one writer, 'by the fact, that of all the observations
made by himself alone, far exceeding those of
any other writer of past or present times, and occupying
in their published form numerous large quarto
volumes, scarcely one has been contravened by subsequent
credible observers, whilst they have formed
the substance of half the numerous compilations on
insect life, acknowledged or otherwise, which have
appeared since his time.'</p>

<p>Goldsmith, who derived his knowledge of this subject
from Reamur, tells us, in his usual free and easy
style, that crustaceous animals (as crabs and lobsters)
'regularly once a year, and about the beginning of
May, cast their old shell, and nature supplies them with
a new one. Some days before this necessary change
takes place, the animal ceases to take its usual food.
It then swells itself in an unusual manner, and by this
the shell begins to divide at its junctures between the
body and the tail. After this, by the same operation,
it disengages itself of every part one after the
other, <i>each part of the joints bursting longitudinally</i>,
till the animal is at perfect liberty. <i>This operation,
however, is so violent and painful that many die
under it</i>; those which survive are feeble, and their
naked muscles soft to the touch, being covered with
a thin membrane; but in less than two days this
membrane hardens in a surprising manner, and a
new shell as impenetrable as the former supplies the
place of that laid aside.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>This, then, was and is to a great extent, up to the
present time, the universally adopted explanation.
Goldie, of course, could not afford time, and it may
be doubted if he possessed the requisite amount of
patience, to confirm what he wrote by actual observation.
Seeing that the statement was graphic in its
details, and evidently either wholly or in part the
result of personal observation, he very naturally gave
it full credence. But what shall we say of a noted
writer (Sir C. Bell)<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who apparently half doubts the
truth of exuviation, for although he mentions the particular
account which Reamur gives, yet tells his
readers that '<i>naturalists have not found these cast
off shells</i>.' After such a remark as this, we need
no longer sneer at the compilations of the author of
the 'Vicar of Wakefield.'</p>

<p>I need hardly state, that at certain seasons of the
year almost every rock-pool at the sea-shore will
exhibit to the observant eye scores of 'these cast off
shells' in a perfect state. The writer above quoted
also remarks, 'We presume the reason that the shells
of the crustacea are not found in our museums, is
because they are not thrown off at once, but that the
portions are detached in succession.' An ill-founded
presumption this, the fact being that the inelastic
integument is invariably (in all the Decapoda at
least) thrown off entire, the eyes and long antennæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
sheaths, the claws with the hair attached, even the
gastric teeth, all remain with wonderful exactness.</p>

<p>To look at the rejected shell, indeed, any person
not previously acquainted with the fact would
naturally suppose that he saw before him the living
animal, a close inspection being necessary to dispel
the illusion. As soon as the crab has emerged from
its old covering, it increases with such astounding
rapidity, that at the end of one or two days it can
grow no larger until the next moulting time.</p>

<p>In referring to my own introduction to the subject
of exuviation, I may be allowed to notice the annoyance
a young aquarian experiences from the
rapidity with which the tank water is apt to become
opaque. As such a state involves considerable
trouble, especially when the occupants of the tank
are the subjects of continued observation, I may
mention, in passing, that the means I adopted to
correct this state of matters was either to syringe
the water frequently, or what seemed to answer still
better, to permit it to run off by a syphon into a
basin on the floor.</p>

<p>When the opacity of the tank is occasioned by
decaying animal matter, the only remedy is to remove
the offending 'remains.' But with many of
the common inhabitants of the tank&mdash;the crustaceans,
for example&mdash;great difficulty is often experienced
in ascertaining their state of health, with a
view to sanitary investigation. As these creatures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
instead of boldly exhibiting themselves during the
day, generally hide under pebbles or pieces of rock,
or are buried in the sand, it is sometimes necessary
to submit the contents of the mimic rock-pool to a
process of 'putting things to rights,' as the ladies
say when about doing a kindness,&mdash;oh, horror!&mdash;to
our books and papers.</p>

<p>It happened on a certain occasion that my
aquarium was in an unsatisfactory condition. A
nasty vapour arose from the base, and diffused itself
over nearly the entire vessel. My fishes disliking
their usual haunts, were all spread out at full length
high and dry upon a ledge of rock-work, projecting
above the surface of the water. The little
Soldier-Crab had managed to drag his body and
heavy tail piece up the brae, hoping to breathe the
fresh air in safety. His big brother was not so successful,
and despite his efforts speedily came to grief.
Finding he could not drag his carriage up the rock, he
stepped out of the lumbering vehicle. His appearance
soon became woe-begone in the extreme. In a few
minutes he expired. The buckies, too, with singular
instinct, had collected in a row along the dry ledge
of the tank.</p>

<p>Upon counting the numbers of my little colony, I
found all right, excepting <i>C. mænas</i>; him I could not
discover, and I soon began to suspect that he was
defunct. No time, therefore, was to be lost, so a diligent
search for his remains was instantly commenced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Fishes, Buckies, Hermits, &amp;c., were speedily placed in
safety in an extemporaneous tank&mdash;nothing else
than an old pie-dish. This receptacle, when partly
filled with sea-water, admirably answered the required
purpose.</p>

<p>The water in the large vase was gently run off,
and on approaching the base I found, as I expected,
the dismembered carcase of the crab. One leg lay
here, and another there, while the body was snugly
esconced beneath a stone, on which sat my favourite
limpet with its curiously formed shell, profusely
decorated with a plume of sea-grass and infantile <i>D.
sanguinea</i>. Here, then, I thought, was the mystery
explained. It was from this spot that the noxious
vapour must have emanated. Of course, the body of
the crab was removed; but in performing this necessary
act I tilted the stone, and so disturbed the
Limpet. Guess my surprise at observing the overturned
shell of the Patella to be quite empty, and its
former occupant lying before me a mass of putrefaction.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
It now began to dawn upon me that I must
have libelled <i>C. mænas</i>. A few moments served to
confirm this opinion, for on lifting the stone, there
darted out <i>a</i>&mdash;I could scarcely believe it was <i>the</i>
crab, who instantly went through a circus-like performance
around the circumference of the vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The reader will be prepared to learn that what I
had at first observed were portions of the exuvium,
which had by some means been distributed over the
tank.</p>

<p>Many months did I wait with nervous anxiety to
see the exact process of exuviation, but, except in
the instances I am now about to chronicle, my
wishes were never gratified.</p>

<p>I had at one time in my possession six little vases,
each containing a crab measuring about one inch
across the back (<i>carapace</i>). By constant watchfulness,
morning and evening, for several months, I
naturally entertained a confident hope of being
favoured with a sight of the moulting operation in
at least a single instance. But no; persevering
though my endeavours were, I was always disappointed.
The exuviæ were cast regularly enough, but
the crabs so managed matters, that the process was
completed either when I was asleep, or had just gone
away. I could almost have sworn that the whole
pack had entered into a league to annoy me.</p>

<p>On one occasion I sat up all night, feeling confident,
from symptoms which a certain Cancer mænas
exhibited, that he was speedily about to exuviate.
Alas! I was mistaken. On my endeavouring to expedite
the event by lifting up the carapace of the
crab, I received a nip on my finger so severe, that I
shall never forget it.</p>

<p>But at length in the early portion of last year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
(1859), I, most happily for my own peace of mind,
did actually witness the entire process of exuviation
in a tolerably large specimen of the Common Shore
Crab. The animal in question, who was domiciled
in a crystal vase, or, in common language, a glass
tumbler, rendered himself a favourite from his constant
habit of poking part of his head and his entire
claw (he had got but one), out of the water whenever
he caught sight of me. Who could resist such a
powerful, though silent appeal to 'the generous impulses
of one's nature' as this? Certainly I could
not, and therefore, once a day at least, gave Master
Cancer the half of a newly-opened mussel, a tit-bit
that was greatly relished. He would sometimes get
a grip of the valve, and allow himself and the Mytilus
to be entirely raised out of the water. Improving
upon this, he would then partly finish his meal
while seated in my hand. On the morning of the
above mentioned eventful day, I gave the crab a
portion of a Pholas, but to my surprise, the heretofore
high-class dainty remained untouched. I was in
ecstasies! for I felt morally certain that the grand
event, so long looked for, was soon to take place.
Consequently, I took out the crab, cleaned the
windows of his dwelling in order that I might the
better see what was going on within, treated him to
some fresh water, as well as a new frond of sea-weed,
and then again introduced my pet to his old apartment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Before doing this I had the animal closely examined,
to see if any signs of the approaching moult
could be detected, but none were visible, except that
the glassy bags, if I may so call them, which for some
weeks had been gradually thrown out from the
stumps of the three mutilated limbs, appeared finer
in texture than usual. Indeed, so transparent had
they become, that I could distinctly see the contour
of the new limb about to be reproduced, folded up
within each capsule.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the crab had been placed in
the tumbler, I gave a peep to see how he was getting
on. To my intense surprise, I observed that his shell
had just opened near the tail! My first feeling was
one of sorrow, thinking that in handling the specimen
I had been too rough, and had perhaps injured
it. This apprehension was soon changed to delight,
as I became by degrees aware that exuviation had
actually commenced.</p>

<p>The operation did not extend beyond five minutes
(although the time appeared much longer to me), and
was carried on by gentle, and at first almost imperceptible
degrees. The shell, or carapace, was slowly
raised over the back, and gave one the idea of the
rear view of a lawyer's white wig when tilted over
his brow, thus exposing the natural black hair
on the occiput below; for, as the body of the animal
came forth, it was very dark in colour, while the old
case assumed a whitish hue. I need hardly say, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
leg sheaths of the crab did <i>not</i> split open, and yet
the corresponding limbs were drawn out with the
greatest ease. Moreover, they did not appear in
view one by one, but in a cluster, as it were, and
packed close to the bent body of the crab.</p>

<p>During the entire process the animal appeared to
use scarcely any exertion whatever, certainly not
half so much as any human being would exhibit in
throwing off the most trifling garment. In fact, the
crab seemed to swell painlessly, and gently roll or
glide out in a kind of ball. Until it had completely
escaped from its old shell, I was somewhat puzzled
to guess what shape it would eventually assume.
The eyes and antennæ, so soon as they left their old
sheaths, commenced, together with the flabellæ, to
work as usual, although as yet they were still inside
the exuvium. This circumstance was distinctly
visible by looking through the side of the half-cast
shell.</p>

<p>It was a curious and extraordinary sight to see
the eyes gradually lose their brilliancy, and exhibit
the filmy, lack-lustre-like appearance of death, while
the act of exuviation was being accomplished. I
may add that the tumbler which held my little captive
stood upon a table near a large window, and
that the sloughing operation was watched through a
powerful hand lens.</p>

<p>On an after and well-remembered occasion, I saw
a moderate-sized Partane standing on the top of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
bush of <i>Chondrus Crispus</i> that grew in my aquarium.
The fronds were attached to a piece of sandstone,
placed uppermost upon a cluster of rock-work,
situated, as before mentioned, in the centre of the
vessel, and rising slightly above the level of the
water. Thinking he was planning means of escape,
I turned away for a few moments to procure a simple
instrument wherewith to carry him to a less elevated
position. On my return I saw him in the act of
backing out of his shell. It was a singular circumstance
that I should have just risen from the perusal
of a talented author, who informed me that 'the crab
hitches one of its claws into some crack or fissure,
and from this point of resistance gives more power
in emerging and withdrawing itself from between the
carapace and the tail.'</p>

<p>Certainly no statement could more inadequately
describe what I had witnessed in both of my crabs.
Not only was the whole operation performed with
perfect ease, but I am much inclined to believe with
a degree of pleasure. For a while one of my crabs
stood in juxtaposition to the shadow of its former
self, and rubbed his antennæ and wee peeping eyes
as if awakening from a sleep. He had been lately,
there was no doubt, living in an oppressed state, and
might probably have surveyed things around him
somewhat darkly, but now all was bright and clear
again. On turning, the first object that caught his
awakened eye was his cast-off vestment, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
seemed to scan as dubiously as a grown man would
an exhumed pair of boyish corduroys, and mutter
musingly, while stroking his chin, 'Well, come what
will, it can never be my <i>case</i> again.'</p>

<p>On taking it in my hand, the Partane felt quite
soft and velvetty to the touch, and exhibited no signs
of alarm.</p>

<p>Since then I have repeatedly had shells of crabs
cast <i>in smooth glass globes, containing nothing else
but clear salt water</i>. This fact, in my opinion, completely
subverts the statements of certain writers,
who assert that these animals require extraneous
assistance when about to exuviate.</p>

<p>Some writers have questioned the truth of the
generally-received opinion that the new parts of
the crab are derived from the old: that, for instance,
a claw is regenerated within a claw, a limb within a
limb, eyes within the eyes, and that on exuviation
each is withdrawn from the pre-existing organ as
from a sheath. But my operations tend fully to
confirm the popular and existing belief.</p>

<p>There is yet one curious point connected with this
subject which requires explanation, as it is not generally
understood. I allude to the apparent disproportionate
smallness of the 'glassy bag,' situated at
the stump, as compared with the size of the regenerated
limb, which is supposed to be folded up within
the bag previous to exuviation. On looking at the
newly-formed member, we can scarcely believe it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
possible that the transparent case could by any possibility
have held it. The mystery vanishes if the
new limb or claw be examined; for, although in
shape it is perfect, even to the most minute particular,
it remains for a certain period comparatively
useless to the animal, from the fact of its being
utterly devoid of flesh.</p>

<p>The new limb, therefore, can be considered merely
as an expanded case, which, by a wonderful law of
nature, becomes slowly filled up and completed.
Immediately after exuviation has taken place, and a
claw is introduced in the place of some mutilated
stump, if any one will pull off the new member, he
can readily confirm the truth of what I have stated,
and, moreover, be able to test into how very small
bulk the new limb may be rolled.</p>

<p>As the reader may remember, Goldsmith states
that the crab casts its shell 'regularly once a-year,
at the beginning of May.' Professor Owen fixes the
date in the month of August. Professor Bell states,
that 'there is no doubt exuviation takes place
<i>annually</i> with great regularity, until the growth is
completed, which, in many species, is not before the
animal is many years old.' Another professor, treating
on the same subject, thus writes, 'We are told
that all this coat of mail is <i>annually</i> thrown off in
a single piece by the contained animal,&mdash;the great
proficient in Chinese puzzles may well be posed at
this greater puzzle.' In fact, all writers whose works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
I have had opportunity of examining repeat the
statement. Mr. Ball, who writes from personal
observation, apparently confirms beyond a doubt,
the annual moult of Crustacea. This gentleman,
we learn, kept a Cray-fish alive for two years in a
vase, and found that <i>during each year its exuvium
was shed but once</i>.</p>

<p>It may readily be believed, with such a formidable
array of contrary evidence, that I offer my own
observations with modesty. But at the same time, I
feel justified in confidently stating that the moult of
the crab, (in its comparatively youthful state, at all
events), takes place not only once, but many times
during each year of its existence. My specimens
may, perhaps, be considered exceptions to the general
rule, but the facts I relate cannot by any possibility
admit of doubt. The cast-off shells lie before me as
I write.</p>

<p>Here is a set of three belonging to the same
animal, exhibiting with marvellous exactness the
gradual development of a broken claw. In the
first the member appears very diminutive, in the
second it is nearly twice its size, while in the third
it has advanced to its natural form and bulk. To
my regret, I cannot state the exact period that
elapsed between each successive moult, but I am
confident that the trio were cast in the course of a
very few months.</p>

<p>I may here take the liberty of informing the uninitiated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that the appearance of the above objects is
extremely pleasing; for, as the exuvium becomes
dry, its colour changes to a bright scarlet, somewhat
resembling that which the crab assumes when placed
for a time in boiling water.</p>

<p>The next series of specimens, five in number,
possess even still greater interest than the first examples.
They were produced by a youthful <i>C.
mænas</i>, at the following consecutive intervals:&mdash;</p>

<p>The first moult took place on 11th April 1858;
the second on the 22d of May following; the third
on July the 3d; the fourth on the 30th of August;
and the fifth on the 26th of September in the same
year. So that between the first and second period
of exuviation there was an interval of forty-one days,
between the second and third forty-two days elapsed,
between the third and fourth fifty-eight days, but,
singular to state, between the fourth and fifth moult
<i>only twenty-seven days intervened</i>.</p>

<p>My first impression was, that as the creature grew
older, its shell would be renewed less frequently, and
the dates of the sloughings seemed to support this
idea&mdash;until the fourth moult. It had occurred to
me that perhaps the operation might be accelerated
by the amount of diet which the crab consumed.
In order to test this, I fed the animal carefully every
day, as though he were a prize beast about to be
exhibited at some Christmas show. Nothing loath,
he ate of everything that was placed before him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a gusto that would have done credit to an alderman.
The result was, that the shell was renewed
in less than half the time that elapsed between the
preceding moults.</p>

<p>These interesting investigations, which had been
conducted thus far so satisfactorily, were suddenly
brought to a close by the death of my protégé.
This sad event occurred unexpectedly, not from overfeeding,
as some persons may suppose, but from
natural causes.</p>

<p>Whether increase of food always produces a like
effect to that mentioned, is a point that I hope some
of my brother naturalists will be able to determine.
That the moult was accelerated by such means in
my own specimen I have not the slightest doubt,
for, on no other grounds can I explain its unusually
speedy occurrence.</p>

<p>I may here assure my readers that the above dates
may be confidently relied upon as correct, and also
that each exuvium was produced by the same crab&mdash;one
specimen only being in the tank during the
whole period.</p>

<p>Since the foregoing was written, I have again
been fortunate enough to have ocular demonstration
of the phenomenon of exuviation, as occurring in a
<i>Cancer Pagurus</i>, about as large as a moderate-sized
walnut.</p>

<p>While watching this crab, it flashed across my
mind that it would be a happy circumstance if by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
any means <i>I could arrest the process then going on
before my eyes, while it was yet only half completed</i>,
in order that others might also be enabled to witness
the marvellous act of exuviation.</p>

<p>But how to carry out this scheme was the rub.
I knew that&mdash;</p>

<p>'If 'twere done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.'</p>

<p>One minute passed,&mdash;two minutes flew by;&mdash;the
crab would speedily complete his labours; still was
I perplexed.</p>

<p>To plump it into fresh water would, I knew, be
fatal to the animal, but not in such a speedy manner
as was desirable. Boiling water next suggested
itself, and doubtless would have answered the purpose
effectually, had a supply been near at hand at
the time, but such was not the case. I then thought
of <i>spirits</i>.  Ah! capital idea....  Before the
third minute had passed, I might be seen to
rush frantically to the sideboard, pour <i>something</i>
into a glass, then dart back to the tank, dive
down my trembling hand, bring up the poor unfortunate
crab, and drop it into a fatal pool of
pure "Glenlivet."</p>

<p>The animal appeared to die quickly, and was
next day transferred to a vessel filled with Mythilated
spirits. As it luckily turned out, the
whisky answered the intended purpose remarkably
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The preparation in question is, as far as I can
discover, <i>unique</i>; at least I have neither read nor
heard of another such existing in any private or
public museum in the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It shows at a glance the increase that instantaneously
takes place in the size of the crab
after the act of exuviation is performed, the portion
exuded being on a scale considerably larger than the
old covering, which, however, is capacious enough
to hold that half of the animal that had not effected
its deliverance at the moment when the novel arrestment
was so unceremoniously served.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth pair of legs are free, while
the eyes and antennæ are also drawn out of their
sheaths. (This is not very evident now, but such is
really the fact, I having distinctly seen those organs
in motion when the animal was in the living state.)
The <i>chelæ</i>, or large claws, being still undetached,
serve to bind the crab to its old integument, and
thus enable the act of exuviation, or one phase of it
at least, to be distinctly apparent.</p>

<p>I know of no work on Natural History that speaks
of the Hermit-Crabs (<i>Anomoura</i>) casting their shells,
and on this account I have given some attention to
them. These animals being so common, I kept by
me at least a dozen specimens for the purpose of
observing some of them, if possible, in the act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
exuviation. The result of my labours has not been
so satisfactory as I could wish, from my not having
been able to collect any 'sets' of exuviæ. I cannot,
therefore, speak with certainty as to the frequency of
this phenomena. By this time my readers will know
that the tail of the Hermit-Crab is very tender and
fleshy, being covered merely with an extremely delicate
membraneous skin, while the carapace, claws,
and antennæ of the animal are protected by a hard
crust, similar to the Lobster, Cray-fish, &amp;c.</p>

<p>From this peculiar formation of the crab, I was
not at all surprised to find, on several occasions, the
upper part of its body alone cast off, and therefore
came to the very natural conclusion, that as the tail
was soft, it would grow and increase in proportion to
the other parts of the animal, without ever needing
the skin to be changed.</p>

<p>Each morning and evening during the time my
experiments were being conducted, I examined all the
tanks attentively, to see whether an exuvium had
been cast. If visible, the object was picked out and
gummed in a box, and a date placed above it for
future reference. After having performed an operation
of this kind one afternoon in October 1858, I
saw a Hermit-Crab (who had cast his shell on the
previous day) hurriedly leave his testaceous dwelling,
then scrape away at his tail, and after a moment's
interval, leap into his old seat again. On inspection,
I found to my surprise <i>that he had actually</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
<i>slipped off the skin of his tail</i>!<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> much in the same
fashion as we would draw off a well-fitting glove.
Here was a strange and unexpected discovery.</p>

<p>On submitting the exuvium to the microscope, we
find that the covering of the false feet, and the cilia
attached to the same, all remained fixed in their
natural position to the tail-piece. Although in
several cases I have had no difficulty in discovering
the rejected cuticle of the tail, at other times it has
eluded my search. The cause of this I cannot explain.
It may be that the animal, adopting the habits
of the toad, swallows a portion of its exuviæ as soon
as cast. On two occasions I found the slough of the
body and claws of a crab, and waited patiently for
several days, without success, expecting to get the
tail portion. Growing impatient, it occurred to me
that it would be a curious experiment to try and
draw off the exuvium with my fingers. This was
easy to talk about, but difficult to perform.</p>

<p>In the first place, the crab would not, if he could
help it, allow himself to be handled even in the most
gentle manner. To overcome this difficulty the
shell had to be broken. This was done; but, alas!
the shock nearly killed the poor little Hermit. After
some trouble, I carefully unwound his body from
the whirls of the Top Shell, and proceeded to perform
the intended operation.  Reader, have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
ever seen a child take a rose-bud in his hands, and
force open its half-pouting blossom, in the belief
that by so doing he was assisting nature? If so,
you must have watched the puzzled expression of
the boy's countenance when he beheld the leaves
fall one by one at his feet, and the bud itself exhibit
evident signs of approaching decay.</p>

<p>In just such a position did I stand with regard
to the poor Hermit-Crab, for, in spite of all my
care in manipulation, the skin of the animal was so
tender and delicate that the first gentle pinch caused
a puncture which proved fatal; and as to drawing
off the covering, the thing I now believe to be
impossible, even under the most favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>The upper portion of the Soldier-Crab, I may
mention, is cast off in one piece, while the animal is
seated in its turbinated dwelling. The act is performed
with the most perfect ease. Unlike the
<i>Brachyura</i>, the <i>Anomoura</i> do not exhibit signs of
such rapid growth immediately after exuviation, but
increase in size very gradually indeed.</p>

<h2>VII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> abundant at many parts of the Scottish
coast, at Cockburnspath (situated near the mouth of
the Frith of Forth) only, has the writer met with the
very beautiful prawn, <i>Palæmon Squilla</i>. At this
locality specimens were very frequent in rock-pools
situated near the shore, nor were such difficult to
capture. The small net being placed cautiously over
their head, the animals did not show signs of resistance,
until they found themselves, by a sudden jerk
of the hand, drawn bodily out of the water. Then,
indeed, unless some degree of skill was used, the
captives would give a powerful spring, and escape,
from the confinement of the net, to the more congenial
element from which they had been so unceremoniously
ejected.</p>

<p>Prawns (<i>Palæmonidæ</i>) exuviate very frequently,
in some instances as often as once or twice a month.
No sooner is one coat thrown off and the Palæmon
recovered from the weakness which the process
occasions, than it commences, at first at intervals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
then almost incessantly day and night, preparations
for a renewal of the wonderful operation.</p>

<p>Every part of the body&mdash;eyes, antennæ, and
especially the sub-abdominal fins, to certain portions
of which the ova are attached in groups, and the
lobes of the tail&mdash;are submitted to a severe rubbing
and brushing process. The appearance of the prawn
at this period is really most interesting, and, I may
also add, amusing. Sometimes the tail is compressed
inwards, beneath the body for a few seconds, and
then suddenly elevated and forced out with donkey-like
extravagance of gesture, the animal the while
standing upon its first pair of forcep-like feet.</p>

<p>At the appointed time the shell opens at the
back part of the head, and the prawn becomes
gradually freed from its old covering. The marvellous
process completed, like all its crustaceous
brethren, the creature becomes to a certain extent
helpless, and if such convenience be afforded, retires
for protection beneath some shell or fragment of rock,
from whence it soon re-appears, and repeats its
gymnastic exercises, which cease, however, for a few
days, as soon as the new coat is sufficiently
hardened.</p>

<p>The prawn is an extremely interesting occupant
of an aquarium, from the fact of its being constantly
on the move, and also on account of the pretty blue
and orange markings of its many-jointed legs, and
the singular transparent appearance of its body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
This latter feature is made still more notable when
the animal happens to have the ova attached, as the
latter are opaque, and of a deep brown colour
approaching to black. By the prawn the act
of exuviation seems to be considered an event of
no slight importance, and, although occurring so
frequently, is fraught with danger. Specimens
oftener die at the moulting time than at any other.
In fact, unless I am very much mistaken, they are
then subject to some peculiar disease, which is apt
to prove fatal. At all events, several of my little
captives, after having performed their gymnastic
movements (before alluded to) for several days,
turned sickly, and died. The commencement of
their illness was always denoted by a small, white,
opaque dot that mysteriously appeared in the centre
of the body. This object speedily increased in size,
until it eventually spread over the entire animal.
Then, no longer diaphanous, the flesh of the prawn
seemed composed of a solid substance not unlike
lime or pounded chalk.</p>

<p>The Shrimp is so common, and so well known, that
a lengthened description of it is unnecessary. I shall,
therefore, merely record an ingenious plan by which
specimens of the <i>Crangon vulgaris</i> may be procured
by visitors at the sea-side, who do not care to wade
in the water with a large net.</p>

<p>It is one generally pursued by Scotch boys as
a mere amusement, for neither shrimps nor prawns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
are eaten to any great extent by the inhabitants of
Scotland generally.</p>

<p>On arriving at a pool, a person will soon know
whether shrimps are contained therein, from the
number of sand clouds that are raised by these little
crusty fellows at any intrusion upon their privacy.
Many persons employ a hand net, and pass it rapidly
through the water, thinking thereby to startle and
entrap the animals in question. Sometimes the plan
succeeds, but more often it turns out a failure.</p>

<p>Instead of using the net, let the young zoologist
stoop down, place the palms of his hands suddenly
upon the surface of the sand, then slowly draw them
near each other, at same time cautiously close the
fingers, and he will in all probability feel the objects
of his search wriggling to escape from his unwelcome
and unfriendly grasp.</p>

<p>To satisfy curiosity, take one of the captured
specimens and drop it in the sand that surrounds the
cavity in which your skill as a shrimper has been
exercised, and I will venture to assert that, in an
instant, the little creature will have disappeared
as if by magic&mdash;such is the wonderful rapidity
with which the shrimp burrows itself. Even when
lying upon the surface a practised eye is required
to detect the presence of a shrimp, in consequence
of its colour being of the exact shade of the sand
in which it hides. In clear pools its body is of a
light drab colour, which becomes changed to a dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
tint when the animal is located in a pool, the base of
which is of a sombre hue.</p>

<p>The prawn, or shrimp, is somewhat of a gourmand,
and requires to be fed occasionally. The most simple
food to give either, when in an aquarium, is an open
mussel or cockle. A marine worm, such for instance
as the <i>Terrebella</i>, however (as on one occasion I
vexatiously discovered), is a dainty more highly
prized than the flesh of a bivalve, but one which
cannot often be indulged in from its comparative
rarity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the reader has been struck at what has been said
in regard to the exuviation of crabs, &amp;c., he will probably
be more surprised when I state that precisely
the same phenomena take place in the simple <i>Acorn
Barnacle</i>, that studs in countless numbers almost
every rock and shell situated between tide marks.
No one can visit the sea-shore, at certain localities,
without noticing the white spots which constitute
the shells of the cirripeds in question, although he
may not be acquainted with the marvellous beauty
of the animal contained within each.</p>

<p>Its loveliness, it is true, is in no wise apparent
when parched and dry; but let the welcome waves
advance and playfully dash their spray against the
dwelling of the little crustacean, and quickly its
valves will open, displaying a delicate feathery
plume, thrust forth and hastily withdrawn again.</p>

<p>As it is not convenient to watch the movements
of this animal in a rock-pool, let me request the
reader kindly to take a peep into my aquarium.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Here is a Trochus shell, for example, inhabited, as
you perceive, by a Soldier-Crab, the surface of
which is thickly covered with shelly cones, of small
dimensions. These are the Barnacles (<i>Balani</i>). The
Trochus most fortunately being near the side of the
glass, is capitally situated for our purpose. Take the
hand lens, adjust its focus, and watch carefully for
the opening of the cones. Tush! The hermit never
<i>will</i> rest contented in any position for two consecutive
minutes; but see! as he walks away the fairy
hands are being rapidly thrown out and made to
sweep the water in graceful curves, thereby suggesting
some resemblance to a bevy of school children
at Christmas time, bidding <i>adieux</i> to their friends,
while seated on the roof of an old stage coach.</p>

<p>Carefully I lift the Pagurus bodily out of the
tank, and transfer him to a wine glass filled with
clean water. After a few minutes have elapsed,
the hands again commence their fishing operations.
Observe, now, that these organs fan the fluid in
such a manner as to catch any animalculæ that
may be near, and draw them towards the aperture
caused by the opening of the valves of the Barnacle.
A close inspection will, I am sure, prove to
your satisfaction that there is also distinctly apparent
a second and smaller cluster of feathery fingers, whose
duty it is to catch the food, brought near by the
larger and corresponding organs, and finally convey
it into the mouth of the little cirriped. There may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
be, in the wide range of Nature's lower scale of life,
prettier sights to gladden the eye of the student than
that above described,&mdash;but if so, I must confess <i>my</i>
inability to indicate where such are to be found.
The fishing apparatus here mentioned consists of a
number of slender <i>cirri</i>, thickly coated with microscopic
filaments (cilia), and is, at certain periods,
thrown off complete and entire by the process of
exuviation, just as we have seen it occur in the
higher crustacea.</p>

<p>Would you, my young friend, like to procure an
exuvium of the Barnacle for examination? Yes.
Then follow the directions I am now about to give,
and your wish will be speedily gratified.</p>

<p>Presuming that your tank already contains a
number of Barnacles attached to various objects, and
that such have been in the same vessel for some
weeks; syringe the water for a few minutes, and you
will find floating about, or rising to the surface, many
specimens of the desired object. They will, in all
probability, be visible to the naked eye. To attempt
to lift one out of the water, however, by means of
your finger and thumb would be utterly useless.
Such a procedure, even were it successful, would
inevitably mar the delicate beauty of this 'inessential'
object, which, spirit like, casts no shadow upon
weed or water. The best plan is to insert a tube of
glass into the aquarium, in such a way that the
exuvium may ascend the interior. Then place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
your finger on the top, and draw the tube out of
the water, and you will be able to deposit the skin
of the Barnacle upon a slip of glass by merely lifting
off your finger. The specimen can then be leisurely
arranged, and spread out by aid of a hand lens and
fine pointed needles.</p>

<p>Walking by the sea-shore one fine summer afternoon,
I met a fisher boy running along with some
curious objects spread out in the palm of his left
hand, while in his right, suspended from finger and
thumb, appeared a still more desirable prize.</p>

<p>At first glance I detected the objects to be specimens
of the <i>Lepas anatifera</i>. They had, so the
boy stated in answer to my inquiries, been plucked
from the base of a ship newly arrived from a long
voyage. When I offered him sixpence for the 'lot,'
the embryo plougher of the deep looked up in my
face with a singularly mistrustful expression, and said,
'D'ye mean it, sir?' I gave speedy assurance of my
sincerity, and on receiving the purchase money, after
handing over the Barnacles to my custody, the young
urchin started off as fast as his legs, encased in huge
wading boots, would allow him. His alarm was
quite unnecessary, for although in a few days after
I would not have given a penny for a thousand, I
would willingly, on the above occasion, have paid
five shillings for a single specimen, rather than have
missed the opportunity of possessing such an interesting
object as the Ship Barnacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>On placing them in water one only of the creatures
showed any signs of life, and by next morning they
made the scentral organ of my face so highly indignant
that, in order to allay its irritability, I was
obliged to remove the defunct animals to the outside
of the window. There they remained for several
months, and were eventually transferred to the
privacy of a card-board box. Although twelve
months have elapsed since the last-mentioned removal
took place, these creatures even now, when
the lid of the case is lifted, give out a smell, so
'antient and fish-like,' that I believe not a few of
'the sweet perfumes of Arabia' would be needed in
order to subdue its power.</p>

<p>One cluster contained thirty Lepades, and the
other eighteen. The average length of each Barnacle
is about three or four inches. One, however, measured
nearly ten inches. The fleshy stalk is of a
purplish-grey colour, semi-transparent, and perfectly
smooth. The shell, which consists of five pieces, is
bluish-white, while that portion from whence the
cirri protrude appears of a brilliant orange, the cirri
themselves being exquisitely tinted with violet,
shaded off to a deep purple.</p>

<p>I may here mention that the above animal was by
our ancestors most unaccountably supposed to be the
young of the solan goose!&mdash;a bird that haunts in
vast numbers the Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig.
Indeed, a common belief in different parts of Scotland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and over the west of England was, that the
shells grew upon certain trees, and in process of time
opened of themselves; whereupon a certain animated
substance contained within the shell dropped
down, and according to the place where it fell
perished or fructified. By falling into the water it
grew to be a fowl; but by falling upon land the vital
principle became extinct. The fowls which resulted
from the more fortunate contingency were called
Barnacle Geese in Scotland, and Brant, or Tree Geese
in England. This delusion appears to have arisen
from the fact of Barnacles having been found in
great abundance on trunks and even branches of
trees long submerged in the sea.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Bishop Hall thus

<h2>IX.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> oblige an English correspondent who requested
some blocks of stone containing Pholas perforations,
the writer, in company with a fellow-student, started
betimes for the sea-shore, some four miles' distance.
We made for a certain spot, where it was expected
the object of our wishes could easily be found. Our
equipment consisted merely of a hammer, a bottle,
and two chisels, enclosed in a carpet-bag, the better
to mask our mission from impertinent curiosity.</p>

<p>On reaching the shore, it soon became painfully
apparent that no pieces of rock could be procured
of a character at all suitable for a museum. To make
matters still more irritating, a breeze arose, and with
it came a furious shower of rain, which soon completely
saturated our light costume. At such a time
it is laughable to note how faint becomes the poetry
of practical zoology&mdash;how excessively like street
puddles are the fairy-grots, as the rock-pools are
called; how unsightly the great, distorted anemones
look, too, when viewed from beneath a large boulder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
where you are crouched in the fond idea that you are
thus getting shelter from the rain.</p>

<p>On this occasion, my friend and I, being soaked to
the skin, started up from our unpleasant position, and
boldly daring the rain to do its worst, proceeded to
hunt after any object of interest that might by chance
be lying stranded near.</p>

<p>After an hour's search, two objects, among many
others of more or less interest, were captured, that
fully repaid us for our uncomfortable 'ducking.'
The first was an elegant Actinia (<i>A. Dianthus</i>),
which seemed to be exquisitely modelled in the
finest virgin wax. The second was a specimen of
the Laminated Nereis (<i>Phyllodoce Laminosa</i>), a
wonderfully beautiful <i>worm</i>!</p>

<p>Fair reader, start not nor curl that rosy lip of
thine at the expression, 'beautiful,' being applied to
such an humble creature, for indeed the title is a just
and true one.</p>

<p>This Annelid is generally found coiled up and
attached to the under part of stones situated near low
water mark. Its general colour is emerald green,
excepting along the centre of the back, which is
iridescent, and reflects a brilliant blue, changing into
purple and other hues, only equalled in beauty by
the enamelled corslet of the brightest beetle, or the
flashing tints that dance upon the plumage of the
humming-bird.</p>

<p>The body of the <i>P. Laminosa</i>, like that of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
other <i>Dorsibranchiate Annelidans</i>, is divided into a
consecutive series of rings. Upon either side of each
ring is situated a singular appendage, which acts as
a gill or branchial organ, by the exercise of which the
blood of the animal is effectually purified, and respiration
adequately provided for.</p>

<p>When the Nereis is in a state of repose, these gills
are laid flat over its back; but in a state of activity
they are fully spread out, and act as 'paddles,' by
aid of which the animal is enabled to glide through
its native element with a graceful serpentine motion.</p>

<p>At the base of each paddle is situated a smaller
one, consisting of a fleshy pedicle shielding a fan-like
bunch of hairs, each of which tapers to a sharp point.
Combined, these hairs or spines form a powerful
defensive weapon, which can be extended or retracted
at will; and it also serves as an <i>oar</i>, or
propeller.</p>

<p>As a noteworthy instance of tenacity of life in the
lower animals, it may be well to mention here that I
have on various occasions, by aid of the microscope,
watched for several minutes the bunch of spines,
above alluded to, thrust out and retracted in a single
segment cut from the body of the Nereis; and only
as the object became devoid of moisture did its beautiful
mechanism cease to play.</p>

<p>The specimen now before me is comparatively
small, being only twelve inches in length, yet its body
contains nearly one thousand lateral appendages, constituting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
it must be admitted, a most extensive and
wonderful locomotive apparatus.</p>

<p>This Annelid is not a suitable object for the
aquarium, on account of its frequent great length, and
the consequent likelihood of its getting entangled
among stones and rock-work when in search of food.</p>

<p>If the hinder parts be cut off, as has been already
hinted, they will exhibit vitality for a considerable
period when placed in water, but we are told it is the
anterior (?) portion of the Phyllodoce which alone
possesses the power of regenerating lost segments;
these will be reproduced sometimes at the rate of three
or four in a week.</p>

<p>'These creatures,' says a learned author, 'as
might be expected from their activity and erratic
habits, are carnivorous; and innocent and beautiful
as they look, they are furnished with weapons of destruction
of a unique and most curious description.
The mouth of the Nereis would seem at first to be a
simple opening, quite destitute of teeth; but on
further examination, this aperture is found to lead into
a capacious bag, the walls of which are provided with
sharp, horny plates, even more terrible than those
which are occasionally to be met with in the gizzards
of some of the higher animals. It is not surprising,
therefore, that by many anatomists the structure in
question has been described as a real gizzard, or by
some as the stomach itself. A little attention to the
habits of the living Annelid will, however, soon reveal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the true character of the organ. No sooner
does the creature wish to seize its food than this so-called
gizzard is at once turned inside out, in which
condition it protrudes from the mouth like a great
proboscis, and the teeth, which were before concealed
in the interior of the cavity, now become external,
and display as formidable an assortment of rasps,
files, knives, saws, hooks, or crooked fangs, as any one
could wish to see. Let us suppose them, when in
this condition, plunged into the body of some poor
helpless victim, while at the same moment the proboscis
is rapidly inverted and withdrawn; the prey
thus seized is at the same instant swallowed, and at
once plunged into a gulf where all struggles are unavailing,
there to be bruised, and crushed, and sucked
at leisure.'</p>

<p>There is a curious fact in connection with these
Annelids which is too interesting to be omitted here.
I allude to the wonderful manner in which their
young are produced by a process that may be called
'sprouting.'</p>

<p>This invariably takes place in the segment immediately
preceding the terminal one. When a new
animal is about to be formed, the reproductive segment
swells, and after a certain time the infant worm
is seen growing from the tail of its parent. When
sufficiently developed, the offspring detaches itself,
and starts life on its own account. Sometimes
before the elder born Annelid is fully formed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
mysterious segment produces a second offspring, and,
according to Professor Milne Edwards, as many as six
young ones may be generated in succession from the
same posterior segment, all of which will for some
time continue attached to the parent worm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the lowest ebb of spring-tide may often be seen
protruding above the surface of the beach an object
that at a little distance might be mistaken for the
twig of a tree, or a decayed and blackened reed.
A close examination discloses it to be a smooth,
tough tube, apparently composed of dark leather or
old gutta-percha, affixed at its lower extremity to
some rock or other solid substance.</p>

<p>The pretty Annelid occupying this dark cylinder
is the Fan-Amphitrite (<i>A. ventilabrum</i>). Unlike
the Terrebella, this animal may really be captured
without much difficulty. The first time I made the
experiment it was successful. By carefully digging
down with chisel, or digits, to the base of the tube,
which may be reached in the course of a few minutes,
the entire structure, with its living occupant, may be
transferred to your extemporaneous tank.</p>

<p>I have an Amphitrite in my aquarium at the present
time displaying its richly-tinted tentacula to
the sun, which lights them up with unusual beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>As the 'case' of this animal is flexible, and as its
owner will only thrive in an upright position, the
reader will easily conceive that to afford the Annelid
suitable accommodation in the aquarium is not a very
easy task. What other naturalists do I cannot tell;
but the following is the plan I adopt for the creature's
comfort and my own gratification:&mdash;</p>

<p>Having procured a small cylinder of glass (or
gutta-percha), close up one end, and drop in the
Amphitrite, taking care to first tie the lower portion
of its sheath with a piece of thread or silk. It is
very pretty to see the plume of the Annelid spreading
completely over and covering the extremity of the
tube, giving the idea in the one instance that the
animal was mysteriously gifted with the power of
exuding gutta-percha instead of its usual mucus.</p>

<p>The Annelid may be made to recline against the
sides of the vase, or be propped up on any chosen
spot by aid of a small cairn of pebbles, and thus form
a very curious feature in the aquarium.</p>

<p>To test a fact, relative to the power which the
Amphitrite is said to possess, in common with other
tubiculous Annelids, of renewing certain portions of
its body after sustaining injury, I snipped off the
principal portions of its branchiæ, and found that,
after the lapse of a few months, my specimen renewed
its mutilated organs.</p>

<h2>XI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> his celebrated journey to the western islands of
Scotland, Dr. Johnson tells us that when at Ulinish,
hearing of a cavern by the sea-side remarkable for
powerful reverberations of sound, he determined to
pay a visit to the spot. After dinner, having procured
the services of some boatmen, the doctor, in
company with Bozzy, started off on his trip, which,
on the whole, appears to have been a pleasant one.
There was, however, no <i>echo</i> to be heard; but to
make up for this disappointment, Mr. Boswell went
angling, and caught a wee 'cuddy,' (a fish about the
size of a gudgeon), while the doctor was gratified by
the sight of some sea-weed growing upon stones, and
above all, at witnessing for the first time <i>Mussels
in their natural state</i>.</p>

<p>The impression made by this candid acknowledgment
upon our minds is one of wonder, that a man
like Johnson could have reached his advanced
years without having seen so common a sight. But
it is possible that even in our day, with its unprecedented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
facilities for cheap travelling for the
most inland inhabitants, there may be many persons
to whom the sight of a Mussel fixed to a
boulder by its self-constructed cable, would be as
great a novelty as it was to the eloquent author of
Rasselas.</p>

<p>It is, however, one of the commonest appearances
which meet the eye of those in the habit of visiting
the sea-shore. At certain localities myriads of Mussels
may be noticed attached to the surface of the
rocks. So thickly are these sometimes covered over,
that the blade of a knife cannot be inserted at any
part without touching one or more of the esculent
bivalves that are to form the subject of this
chapter.</p>

<p>The Mussel anchors itself by means of the
Byssus; or, as it is commonly termed, the 'beard.'
This appendage is composed of various slender
threads which are attached to any object within
reach, whether such be the shell of a neighbouring
Mussel, a small stone, or huge boulder. The members
of each colony are thereby bound together, it
may be figuratively said, by the silken cords of
friendship, and mayhap of love. The <i>Mytili</i> evidently
believe that 'there's no place like home.' Although
gifted with a power of moving about at will,
they never attempt to exercise this when living together
in a family circle, but pass through life's
stages upon the spot where they were born. Certainly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
if there be such a sight as a truly happy and
contented family in the marine animal kingdom,
it is to be found exemplified in these bearded
molluscs.</p>

<p>As hinted, they live shoulder to shoulder, back to
back, and otherwise mutually support each other.
They need not look about for a single meal, but
have merely to allow themselves to be fed by the
waves, which yield them a constant supply of fresh
and wholesome food. Their sole duty in this respect
is limited to the selection of objects suitable to their
palate. Their 'at homes' being so frequent, the
<i>Mytili</i> can boast of a large circle of acquaintances.
The Periwinkle, and his friend Silver Willie, often
make a morning call, take pot luck, as it is termed,
and then politely retire. <i>Mr. Carcinus Mænas</i> and
his poor and dirty relation, <i>Maia Squinado</i>, perchance
look in of an evening. <i>Solaster Papposa</i>, or
occasionally the lanky-legged <i>Uraster Rubens</i>, and
other 'stars' of the marine world, crawl in at unseasonable
hours in their usual lazy style, and are generally
rewarded by finding the doors (valves) shut
against them. This 'cut direct' does not appear to
be at all annoying; or if so, the Star-fishes are too
cunning to show it, for they quietly saunter away as
if they never had the slightest wish to put their feet
within their neighbour's dwelling.</p>

<p>There is a 'black sheep,' as Sir Pertinax Mac
Sycophant would say, who intrudes himself into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Mussel society, and plays sad havoc among its members.
This crawling rascal is the wolf of all Musseldom
flocks. Young and old alike experience the
blighting effects of his villanous propensities. The
name of this obnoxious personage is <i>Purpura Lapillus</i>
(Common Whelk). What, the reader will ask in
surprise, a univalve prey upon a bivalve? Is that
possible? It is, unfortunately, too true.</p>

<p>If we take a Mussel in our hand we shall find it
perfectly impossible to force its valves asunder, without
the aid of a strong knife or other instrument;
yet the Common Whelk, fleshy and insignificant creature
though it be, will consume the animal within,
and make the valves fly open in a brief space of
time, by means of its soft tongue. But leaving
such general remarks, let us suppose we are standing
before a boulder covered with these mussels. Numbers
of gaping shells may be at intervals perceived
still attached to the rock, but with the interior of
each valve so empty and smooth, that we could
scarce believe they had ever embraced a living occupant.
On taking up one of the valves and closely
examining it, do you observe nothing peculiar about
it now? 'No.' Take up the other then, and submit
it to a similar inspection. Well, what do you see
now? 'Nothing,' you still reply, 'unless it be a
peculiar little hole about the size of a pin's head,
which surely is of no importance.' That little hole
was of <i>vital</i> importance to the poor mollusc, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
through that aperture the life and substance of the
Mytilus was drawn by the voracious Purpura.</p>

<p>But the poor Mussel is exposed to the attacks of
other enemies&mdash;aquatic birds, as sea-gulls and
ducks, eagles, vultures. Even water-rats and monkeys
may also be included in the list.</p>

<p>It is amusing to see a gull, by no means a foolish
bird, standing patiently before a Limpet, for example.
The animal, unsuspicious of the presence of an enemy,
raises his canopy with the view of relaxing his overstrained
muscles, and is instantly toppled over by
the intruding beak of the bird. If unsuccessful in
his first attempt, the gull is well aware it would
be useless to try a second time at that tide.</p>

<p>But if a Mussel be the object of attack, it is
wrenched from its seat, raised to a certain height,
and then allowed to drop upon a stone with the
view of breaking the shell. In one locality called
Mussel Bay, Mr. Barrow says he disturbed some
thousands of birds, and found so many thousands of
shell-fish scattered over the surface of a heap of
shells, that, for aught he knew, would have filled as
many thousand waggons.</p>

<p>This habit of the feathered tribe was, by the way,
well known to the ancients, and I may be pardoned
relieving my pages by a quotation on the subject
from the 'Shepherd's Calender' of Spenser, whose
exquisite descriptions of natural history are as marvellous
as his allegorical poem. The author of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>

an ambitious man,&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>It seems remarkable that the 'illustrious French
naturalist,' Reaumur, should have been the first, if not
to discover, at least to publish, any description of the
manner in which the Mussel spins its silken cable.
Yet one hour's experience in a tea-cup or tumbler
will exhibit most of the features in this interesting
process.</p>

<p>That Reaumur's narrative, although usually copied
by most writers of the present day, is not strictly
correct, and, moreover, that the foot of the mussel is
<i>not</i> 'useless as an instrument of progression' (as
generally asserted), may be easily proved to the
satisfaction of the student by adopting some such
simple experiment as that which I am now about to
describe:&mdash;</p>

<p>Being at the sea-side on a fine summer afternoon,
I procured three specimens (I might have had as
many hundreds if disposed) of the Mytilus. On my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
return home I placed them in a common tumbler,
and waited patiently to see the result. My object
was, if possible, to witness the manner in which this
animal grows its beard.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes an industrious little
fellow, whom we will call No. 1, gently opened his
shell, and immediately protruded his fleshy foot until
it reached a length of nearly two inches. So far as
I could determine, the design of the Mussel was to
discover, in the first place, what kind of a lodging he
occupied; whether or not he had any companions;
and also, to know if these or any other objects could
be found worthy of his <i>attachment</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes the foot would be protruded under the
shell, then in a contrary direction. Or by an
exertion of the strong muscular power which that
organ possesses, the entire shell would be lifted off
the ground and urged forward to a considerable distance.
Of course he soon come in contact with a
neighbour Mussel, whom we may term No. 2, but as
the latter was not anchored by any byssus, he was
speedily pushed on, and on, until No. 3 was met,
and the latter, in his turn, made to take up a new
position.</p>

<p>Being tired of wandering about, No. 1 then extended
his foot along the base of the vase to a
certain point, and there let it rest for a few seconds.
When again withdrawn, to my great delight, I saw
the first thread of a new byssus had been constructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>As my principal object was to become acquainted
with the mode of formation of the beard, I did
not feel satisfied with merely watching the movements
of the animal from above. After a brief
interval another thread was spun. I bore in mind
the words of Reaumur, who says, 'The Mussel never
spins more than four or five threads in the twenty-four
hours.' Aware that no time must be lost,
though still afraid to disturb the mollusc lest it
might suspend its labours, I instantly detached my
specimen, and again turned its shell round so as to
bring the opening of the valves against the face of
the glass. The creature did not seem at all offended
at his handiwork having been destroyed, but still
obstinately refused to let me see the working of its
foot. Again was the shell rolled over, and again did
I replace it in its former position. This time, in
order to keep it from being shifted, a stone was deposited
upon the valve. Nothing daunted, the
animal gradually separated the valves of its shell,
and at the same time advanced and elevated its foot
to the exact position that I had so long desired.</p>

<p>The spinner, when at its full length, was pressed
firmly upon the flat surface of the glass, and there
allowed to remain for a while. Suddenly, at nearly
<i>half an inch distance from its extreme end</i> (or
point), a little mouth was seen to form, about the
size of a large pin's head, from which there issued a
milk-white fluid, that gradually hardened and became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
fixed to the glass. This object being light in
colour, had a pretty effect when contrasted with the
rich brown tint of the spinner. Shortly afterwards
the foot rolled over and withdrew into the shell,
leaving behind it the silken thread which had just
been spun. The 'little mouth,' above described, was,
if I may so term it, the mould in which the end of
the thread was cast.</p>

<p>In the course of two hours a bundle of byssus
threads, sixteen in number, were produced by this
industrious little labourer.</p>

<p>Having thus seen that the foot is useful to the
Mussel as an instrument of progression <i>before</i> the
beard is formed, let me now endeavour to show that
it is, at times, of equal service for the same object,
<i>after</i>, and when the mollusc is anchored thereby to
any particular spot.</p>

<p>When we remember that this anchorage is formed
of a harp-like set of strings, amounting to ten or
even <i>a hundred</i> in number, it does seem an almost
incredible fact that the Mytilus is enabled to change
its station, even when living in single blessedness.</p>

<p>To see a Mussel 'flit,' is a sight one may often
watch and wait for without success. On the other
hand, when least expected, the self-willed mollusc
may commence operations. When about to take up
a new home, the animal shaves off its beard entirely,
or in more scientific language, 'rejects its byssus'
altogether.  In order to excite the locomotive instincts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of my specimens, I used to cut all the threads
of their cable except one. The animal being suspended,
of course its whole weight was then thrown
upon a single fibre. Such a state of insecurity was
by no means agreeable, and I generally found in the
course of a few hours that fresh threads were rapidly
thrown out, and an entirely new byssus formed; the
old one, which was broken off at the root, being left
behind as useless.</p>

<p>Another singular peculiarity of the Mussel which
came under my observation has not been, so far as I
am aware, noticed by previous naturalists. I allude
to the power which the animal possesses of lengthening
out the root or stem of the beard, apparently to
an unlimited extent. This power appears to be
seldom exercised, for although I have had hundreds
of specimens of the Mytili, in only one instance have
I witnessed the phenomenon in question.</p>

<p>A large specimen of this bivalve, procured accidentally
from a fishwife in the street, was dropped
into the aquarium, and placed close against the surface
of the glass. The animal seemed highly delighted
with its change of situation, for in a few
moments the valves were opened, and a long draught
of water taken in to bathe its branchiæ, and furnish
a hearty meal. Having satisfied its appetite, the
next process, of course, was to find out what kind of
a home he had been introduced into. The foot, a
noble specimen, was soon protruded, and one after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
other, in rapid succession, various threads were formed.
By next morning the animal, advancing by a series
of easy stages, had reached the surface of the water,
which was exactly five inches deep. I knew it
would not remain long in this position, and was
anxious to discover what plan would next be adopted.
Several courses were open to him. For instance,
like a marine Captain Cook, he might circumnavigate
his little <i>Globe</i>,&mdash;or he might let go his cable and
drop plump to the bottom,&mdash;or he could follow the
route I had often seen taken by his relations, viz.,
to journey back to the place from whence he started.
It pleased him, however, to strike out into a new
path,&mdash;to devise a method of his own. While located
near the top of the tank, he threw out exactly ninety-eight
threads, not certainly for security, but merely,
it would appear, for pleasure.</p>

<p>Then slowly but surely, day by day, he lengthened
out the stem of his byssus tree, until it reached the
extreme length of nearly five inches. To what
further degree it would have been extended, had the
mollusc not reached the base of the tank, it is impossible
to conjecture.</p>

<p>No sooner did the shell touch terra firma, than the
cable which had taken so long to spin was immediately
broken off. I have succeeded in keeping the
same animal by me for the last twelve months, but
have seen no attempt at a renewal of the operation,
in the progress of which I had taken so lively an interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
I may add that this Mussel taught me
another lesson; it was this: in my early studies
regarding the habits of the Mytilus, I had adopted a
certain theory of the manner in which the beard was
formed; and having watched so long, and witnessed
the process so repeatedly, I thought myself justified
in forming certain conclusions. My belief was that
the creature could not form more than one thread at
a time, <i>without withdrawing its foot into the shell</i>,
as I believed, in order to procure a fresh supply of
material. That this notion was erroneous, this animal
proved to my entire satisfaction. Not only may one,
but two, three, four, and even six threads be attached
to any selected object, the point of the foot being
passed from one position to another, without the
organ being withdrawn into the valves until the
whole of the threads are formed. How many more
the Mussel is capable of producing at one 'stretch,' I
have no means of knowing, but six is the largest
number that any of my specimens in such case have
ever fabricated.</p>

<p>The general idea seems to be that the Mussel
works in the same manner as the spider, who emits
a drop of liquid against some foreign substance,
which, being allowed to harden somewhat, is then
drawn out as the spider recedes. This notion, I
may state, is quite erroneous. When the sucker of
which we have spoken is formed, <i>the thread is completed</i>.
It is true that the foot as it retires into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
shell generally glides down the newly-constructed
filament, but this is not of necessity, nor does such
circumstance invariably occur. Indeed, while busily
engaged in attaching a disc to the glass, the muscles
of the foot will contract, and thus throw open the
folds of the groove, situated in the middle of that
organ; when thus exposed, the byssus thread may be
seen in the furrow, stretched like the string of a harp
or dulcimer.</p>

<p>While the end of the thread is being attached to
a certain spot, a conspicuous muscular action is perceived
going on in the foot, which alternately swells
and contracts, as if something were being pumped up
through the byssal channel, until it reached a certain
point. There being dilated and spread out in successive
layers, it assumes a trumpet-like disc, which is
firmly fixed to the foreign object. Indeed, I am by
no means certain that the thread is not, when first
produced, exactly like a trumpet in shape. It also
conveys the idea of being blown out in a similar
manner to a piece of bottle glass. After being exposed
to the air for some little time, the hollowness
of the thread is not so apparent as when it is newly
fabricated.</p>

<p>The mucous fluid, from which the fibres are
formed, is secreted in a gland situated at the base of
the foot, whence it is apparently expelled at the will
of the animal into the furrow already referred to, and
is there spun into threads.  The toughness of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
filaments, considering that each is finer than the
thinnest strand of silk, is remarkable. Their strength,
however, may be easily accounted for, when we know
that each is composed in reality of innumerable delicate
threads, bound together by a subtle gelatinous
fluid. This phenomenon may be made out quite distinctly
with a common hand lens, if the following
simple experiment be adopted: Make a Mussel construct
its thread in such a way that the disc of each
is planted on the face of the glass. Then place the
fine point of a common needle upon the outer edge
of a chosen disc or sucker, and gently draw the
former away to a little distance, and you will find
that by so doing the stretched string becomes <i>peeled</i>.
Continue this process carefully, and before the thread
gives way you will have divided it into a dozen
parts at least, all of which are visible to the naked
eye, but clearer when the hand lens is used, and still
more distinctly and beautifully defined, of course, if
the microscope be brought into play.</p>

<p>The foot of the Mussel appears to be firmly
strapped on, as it were, to certain transverse muscles,
by a contraction of which the animal closes its shell
with surprising force. This strap, composed of a
powerful tendon which passes under the adductor
muscles, is attached at either end to the base of the
foot. Thus we account for the remarkable strength
which is evidently seated in the foot, and makes
it of so much importance to the animal.  At first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
sight nothing appears more easy than to pluck out
this organ by the roots, but an attempt will prove
the experiment to be more difficult than many persons
suppose.</p>

<p>The colour of the foot varies considerably in different
specimens, even of the same species. Some, for
instance, are of a chestnut brown; others of a kind
of mauve or purple, covered with a peach-like bloom
during life; others, again, are of a deep-toned umber,
while not a few are pearly white, and streaked sometimes
with pink like a tulip.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of the Mussel to attach itself to
foreign substances has been taken advantage of for
the benefit of man, and a curious instance is exhibited
at Bideford in Devonshire, at which town there is a
bridge of twenty-four arches, stretching across the
Torridge river near its junction with the Taw. 'At
this bridge the tide flows so rapidly that it cannot be
kept in repair by mortar. The corporation, therefore,
keep boats in employ to bring mussels to it, and the
interstices of the bridge are filled by hand with these
mussels. It is supported from being driven away
entirely by the strong threads these mussels fix to
the stonework.'</p>

<p>Like most other writers who quote this strange
account, I have not had ocular proof of its accuracy.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
That it is quite probable I can readily believe, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
pretty experiment will partly prove it to any spirited
aquarian. Following out the above idea of the
bridge at Bideford, I managed to build an exceedingly
pretty centre piece for my tank.</p>

<p>Having no ready means of making a rock arch, I
collected such pieces of rock, stones, &amp;c., with weeds
attached, as I thought would answer my purpose,
and then proceeded to fabricate the object of my
wishes in the following simple way: First were
laid two stones parallel to each other at three or
four inches apart. Upon these I placed a large piece
of rock in a transverse direction. Between the interstices
a number of small mussels were then inserted.
When fully satisfied that the bivalves had
moored themselves, I gradually piled one piece of
rock upon another until the structure reached the
desired height, each piece being bound to its neighbour
by means of the byssus threads of the Mytili.</p>

<p>Before each block of stone that formed the foundations
of the arch was placed a splendid frond of
Lettuce Ulva, tied by a strand of silk to a white
pebble. These verdant fronds, so smooth in texture
and so gracefully convoluted, rising up from the base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of the tank and reaching to its brim,&mdash;mingling, too,
with the various tufts of corallines and other sea-weeds
that jutted from each crevice, were very pretty
to look at. When disturbed by the movements of
the fishes passing in and out, the gracefulness and
beauty of the sea-weed was doubly increased.</p>

<p>In making observations upon any bivalve, such as
the Mussel, it is extremely puzzling to know what is
going on <i>inside</i> the shell. Yet it is almost necessary
to acquire this knowledge by means not always apparent,
in order to satisfy one's mind relative to
certain appearances, which we perceive going on
externally. We have to form our judgment of things
we do not see from those that are apparent&mdash;at all
times a difficult task. But not often so tantalizing
as in the case of an insignificant creature like the
Mussel, who lives, moves, and works constantly
before our eyes. I may add that it was not enough
for me that I saw the spinning process frequently.
It all seemed tolerably clear to my mind, but still I did
not feel thoroughly satisfied. My desire was to peep
into the shell, and find out where the last spun thread
was situated; or, in other words, from what part of
the trunk the new branch sprung. On examining
various specimens of the byssus, this point was by
no means apparent. Various means I adopted
failed to secure me the requisite knowledge. At
length I hit upon a plan, which, after no long time,
I found opportunity to put in practice. My largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Mussel lifted up its testaceous canopy, put aside the
fringed and fleshy veil that surrounded its edge,
protruded its spinner to make sure the ground was
secure, and then withdrew it again into the shell as
usual. After the lapse of a second, the foot reappeared
and was stretched out to an unusual length.
No sooner was the end of the thread formed on the
glass than immediately I firmly pressed the valves
together, and held them in this position until I had
gradually worked the Mussel up out of the vase,
when I bound them close together by means of a
piece of cord. I need not describe my man&oelig;uvres
further; suffice it to say that the thread nearest to
the base of the groove was found to be the one that
was spun last. This, in my opinion, is invariably
the case.</p>

<p>I may mention that the above experiment also
proved to my mind that the foot must be a most
important vital organ of the Mytilus. At times, on
placing an open Mussel in my tank as food for crabs
or other animals, I have noted that if every other
part were eaten, and the foot allowed to remain
attached to the muscles of the bivalve, that member
would after a lapse of several days show signs of&mdash;I
do not say life&mdash;but sensation and retractile power.</p>

<p>But when the foot is cut and otherwise injured,
the animal dies quickly. In the experiment mentioned
the valves were not kept closed for more than
half an hour; yet when they were opened, vitality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
had evidently ceased within. This was the more
singular when we remember that the Mytili will live
for many days out of the water; the shells, of course,
during the whole period being firmly closed.</p>

<p>The Mussel, as already hinted, is very tenacious of
life. I have kept specimens by accident for several
days in the pocket of my coat, but found them quite
well and lively when placed in sea-water.</p>

<p>In general the sure sign of their not being in a
healthy condition is when the shell opens; for, while
the animal retains any sense whatever, it exercises a
strict and judicious 'closeness.'</p>

<p>I have found, however, on several occasions, that
the shell being contracted is not always a valid proof
of its owner's convalescence, for when placed in water
the Mussel would float for several days upon the
surface like a cork, although it was near death's door.</p>

<p>This phenomenon must be caused, I should
suppose, by some sudden fright compelling the
mollusc to close its shell with such rapidity as to
prevent a proper supply of water being taken in.
Having only air to exist upon, the animal then
lingers on until its branchiæ become dried up, and
all moisture exhausted. In this state the Mussel
opens its shell with a deep bursting sigh, and sinks to
the bottom&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>Being at the sea-side one fine summer day, I
heard a little Scotch girl cry out to her brother who
was about to swallow entire, a fine specimen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
<i>Mytilus edulis</i>, 'Eh, Willie dear, dinna ye eat that.
Dinna eat the <i>beard</i> or ye'll dee!' Many years ago
I remember a remark to the same purport as the
above being made by a poor child to its playmate,
in the neighbourhood of Gravesend.</p>

<p>I little thought at that time that the Mussel
was so interesting a shell-fish, or that I years after
should spend many an anxious hour studying the
formation and nature of its despised beard.</p>

<p>I need hardly state that the idea of the beard
being poisonous is a vulgar error. In general the
fish may be eaten entire with impunity.</p>

<p>Cases have occurred where persons have been taken
ill after eating it, but this result has been satisfactorily
explained to have been caused by the Mussels
being procured from places such as Leith Docks,
where their food consisted chiefly of unwholesome
and putrescent matters.</p>

<p>This mollusc is not used as food to any very great
extent by the poorer classes. It is employed very
extensively, however, by the fishermen as bait along
all parts of the British coast. But in France it is
much esteemed both by rich and poor. The trade in
them is successfully cultivated, and affords a means
of support to hundreds of industrious and deserving
men.</p>

<p>From the learned author of the "Rambles of a
Naturalist" we learn that at the village of Esnandes,
on the coast of France, the Mussel trade, commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
about eight hundred years ago, has assumed a gigantic
extent. Both here and at the neighbouring villages
of Charron, Marsilly, Mussels are bred in an ingenious
and systematic manner. At the level of the
lowest tide short piles or stakes are driven into the
mud, in a series of rows about a yard apart. This
palisade is then roughly fenced in with long branches.
On this structure the Mussel spawn is deposited, and
it is found that the molluscs thus produced in the
open sea are much finer than those which are bred
nearer the shore.</p>

<p>These artificial Mussel beds are termed 'bouchots.'
The fishermen who engage in this branch of industry
are known as 'boucholeurs.'</p>

<p>'The little Mussels,' continues M. Quatrefage, 'that
appear in the spring are known as <i>seeds</i>. They are
scarcely larger than lentils, till towards the end of
May, but at this time they rapidly increase, and in
July they attain the size of a haricot bean. They
then take the name of <i>renouvelains</i>, and are fit for
transplanting. For this purpose they are detached
from those <i>bouchots</i>, which are situated at the lowest
tide mark, and are then introduced into the pockets
or bags made of old nets, which are placed upon the
fences that are not quite so far advanced into the sea.
The young Mussels spread themselves all round the
pockets, fixing themselves by means of those filaments
which naturalists designate by the name of byssus.
In proportion as they grow and become crowded together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
within the pockets, they are cleared out and
distributed over other poles lying somewhat nearer
to the shore, whilst the full-grown Mussels which are
fit for sale are planted on the <i>bouchots</i> nearest the
shore. It is from this part of the Mussel bed that
the fishermen reap their harvest, and every day enormous
quantities of freshly gathered Mussels are transported
in carts or on the backs of horses to La
Rochelle and other places, from whence they are sent
as far as Tours, Limoges, and Bordeaux....  The
following data, which were collected by M. D. Orbigny
more than twenty years ago, will show how important
this branch of industry must be to the district in
which it is cultivated. In 1834 the three communes
of Esnandes, Charron, and Marsilly, representing a
population of 3000 souls, possessed 340 <i>bouchots</i>,
the original cost of which was valued by M. D.
Orbigny at 696,660 francs; the annual expenses of
maintaining them amounted to 386,240 francs,
including the interest of the capital employed, and
the cost of labour, which, however, is spared to the
proprietor who works on his own account. The nett
revenue is estimated at 364 francs for each <i>bouchot</i>,
or 123,760 francs for the three communes. Finally,
the expense of the carts, horses, and boats, employed
in transporting the Mussels, then amounted annually
to 510,000 francs; but these numbers are far from
representing the expenses or profits at the present
day. At the time M. D. Orbigny lived at Esnandes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the <i>bouchots</i> were only arranged in four rows; now
however, there are <i>no less than seven rows, and some
of them measure more than 1000 yards from the
base to the summit</i>. The whole of these <i>bouchots</i>,
which were at first limited to the immediate neighbourhood
of the three villages, of which I have already
spoken, extend at the present day uninterruptedly
from Marsilly far beyond Charron, and <i>form a gigantic
stockade for two miles and a half in breadth, and
six miles in length</i>.'</p>

<p>A curious circumstance connected with the Mytilus
remains to be described. Let the reader, who may
be so fortunate as to possess a good microscope, cut
away a portion of the fleshy part of the Mussel, then
place it in a watch glass, and examine it through
that 'portal to things invisible,' and, unless I am
much mistaken, he will own the sight to be supremely
wonderful. Some water being deposited in the glass
the fleshy object will be seen to swim about in a
most singular and mysterious manner, while a close
inspection shows every portion of it to be in active
motion.</p>

<p>This motive power is caused by countless cilia,
the rapid vibration of which creates constant currents.
This action preserves the health of the poor mollusc
by ærating the water which passes over his respiratory
organs.</p>

<p>That some such wonderful contrivance is adopted,
for conveying food within the valves, too, is evident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
when we consider that the Mussel is always affixed
to some foreign substance, that it cannot hunt after
prey, and therefore can subsist only upon whatever
nutritious particles may be contained in the element
in which it lives. These consist of minute animalculæ,
principally crustacea, which are drawn within
the shell by powerful currents.</p>

<p>I have often watched this phenomenon through a
hand lens, and have seen the young shrimps and
skip-jacks, for instance, notwithstanding the nimbleness
of their movements, irresistibly drawn into the
gulf of destruction. Even tolerably sized specimens
that were seated in fancied security upon a valve of
the Mussel, have suddenly been drawn in, out of
sight. As an instance of the power of these currents,
I may state that the water in a small aquarium
is often seen to be affected by the respiratory action
of a single bivalve. The same thing has even been
apparent to the writer, while watching the movements
of a colony of Barnacles attached to a Limpet,
the most distant part of the fluid being gradually
drawn near, in obedience to the beck of these delicate
and graceful little creatures.</p>

<h2>XII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> visited the sea-side a few weeks since, along
with some 'aquarian naturalists,' among other objects
we managed to capture a very fine <i>Terebella
Figulus</i>, commonly called the 'Potter.' The specimen
measured about five inches in length, and was
nearly as thick as a common drawing pencil. I
could discover no signs whatever of any tube in the
rocky basin in which the Annelid was situated, a
circumstance that struck me as being rather curious.</p>

<p>On returning home, my much-valued prize was
placed in a tumbler of large dimensions, the base of
which I strewed with newly-pounded shells and
gravel. By the following morning all the fine or
powdered portion of the 'Silver Willies' had been collected
and used in the construction of a tube, sufficient
in length to cover half the contracted body of the
industrious little mason. After labouring for a fortnight,
the tube was gradually extended across the
bottom of the vase in a cylindrical form, but eventually
it assumed a semi-circular shape, being built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
upon the glass, and elevated by gentle stages up
each side of the vessel until the level of the water
was reached, when all further labours ceased for a
time.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a few days the building operation
was resumed, and the tube carried fully an inch
further, at right angles to its former position. The
opposite end of the structure was next extended at
an angle of 45° from the base of the vase, to a height
of about two inches. Then commenced a very curious
phenomenon. Some of the tentacles were incessantly
elevated and extended across the vessel,
until they touched the opposite end of the tube, with
what object I could not then conceive. The design,
however, was afterwards made evident: in less
than two days the animal succeeded <i>in making
both ends of its tube meet together, so as to form a
continuous circle</i>. I happened to be watching the
mason, when the last stroke of his labial trowel was
given to the building, and shall never forget the
cautious way in which the animal crept for the first
time over the newly-completed portion of the work,
and the seeming delight with which it continued to
glide, hour after hour, over the entire circuit of its
dwelling-place.</p>

<p>Sometimes its body would be long drawn out,
until the tips of the tentacula would reach, and apparently
tickle the extreme point of the tail; then
a race would commence, in character exactly resembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
that so often witnessed with the kitten, or
the playful whelp, when either of these animals
foolishly imagine that the tip of their tail is adorned
with some coveted tit-bit.</p>

<p>The branchial organs of my specimen were very
beautiful objects, being formed of three blood-red
spiral tufts, the effect of which were heightened by
their being placed in contact with the drab, coloured
cephalic<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> tentacles, which seemed to be almost innumerable.
These latter organs, although apparently
so useless when seen closed, are in reality of the
greatest importance to the <i>Terebella</i>, for they not
only act as auxiliary organs of respiration, and aid
most materially in building its dwelling-place, but
also constitute the real organs of locomotion.</p>

<p>'They consist,' says Dr. Williams, 'of hollow
flattened, tubular filaments furnished with strong
muscular parietes. The band may be rolled longitudinally
into a cylindrical form, so as to enclose a
hollow cylindrical space, if the two edges of the band
meet, or a semi-cylindrical space if they only meet
imperfectly. This inimitable mechanism enables
each filament to take up and firmly grasp <i>at any
point of its length</i> a molecule of sand, or, if placed
in a linear series, a row of molecules. But so perfect
is the disposition of the muscular fibres at the
extreme free end of each filament, that it is gifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
with the twofold power of acting on the sucking
and muscular principle.</p>

<p>'When the tentacle is about to seize an object, the
extremity is drawn in, in consequence of the sudden
reflux of fluid in the hollow interior. By this movement
a cup-shaped cavity is formed, in which the object
is securely held by atmospheric pressure. This
power is, however, immediately aided by the contraction
of the circular muscular fibres. Such, then,
are the marvellous instruments by which these peaceful
worms construct their habitation, and probably
sweep their vicinity for food.'</p>

<p>The foregoing beautifully and accurately describes
the tentacular cirri. The use of these organs in the
formation of the tube in which the Annelid dwells,
I will now endeavour to make clear, from close
personal observation.</p>

<p>It is an extremely interesting sight to watch a
Terebella extend its tentacles in all directions in
search of building materials, catching up the surrounding
molecules (sometimes visible along the
whole length of each filament), and then, by a strong
muscular contraction, bringing the collected atoms
to the opening of the tube, around which, as is generally
supposed, they are then immediately attached
by a secretion which is exuded from the body of the
animal. Such, however, is not the case.</p>

<p>When the filaments bring their 'subscriptions,' the
material thus gathered, instead of being used at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
for building purposes, <i>is, in reality, first eaten by the
animal, and, after undergoing a kind of mastication,
becomes coated with a salivary secretion, and
is then ejected in mouthfuls at the extremity of the
tube</i>, which, by such means, becomes gradually elongated.
The shell work, when deposited as above
mentioned, is held in position, and prevented from
falling over the outside of the cavity, by the filaments
which are made to hang down in a most ingenious
manner; the animal, at the same time, putting
itself in motion, allows the slimy surface of its body
to press and rub against the new addition to the tube,
which is thus effectually strengthened and soldered
together.</p>

<p>The animal does not always wait until the opening
of the tube is reached, but gently disgorging
while lying at its ease, it then pushes forward by aid
of its head and tentacles the mass of building material,
which soon becomes distributed and moulded
to its proper shape.</p>

<p>If your specimen should happen to build a complete
tube, its mode of working cannot be well seen;
but should it economize its labours, and run its house
up in a semi-circular form against the transparent
side of the vessel, as the animal I write of did, you
will be enabled to see distinctly every movement
that goes on in the interior.</p>

<p>It seems somewhat singular that the Terebella
should possess the power of turning itself within its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
tube, so as to be able to extend its habitation from
either end at will. I have very often watched the
operation with emotions of pleasure, not unmixed
with wonder.</p>

<p>Wishing to test the powers and intelligence of my
specimen, I dropped within its tube, which was
curved in shape lengthways, some particles of sand,
and a pebble which nearly filled up the 'bore' of
the cylinder. The great annoyance occasioned by
this intrusion to the master of the house was painfully
evident. For a whole day the Terebella endeavoured
to push out the objectionable matter by
means of its head and cephalic tentacula, but without
success; for although the mass frequently neared,
it never touched or toppled over the mouth of the
aperture, and consequently fell to its original position
at the bottom of the tube as soon as the animal removed
the pressure.</p>

<p>Apparently despairing of its efforts, though still
oftener repeated, being eventually prosperous, the
poor Annelid literally 'turned tail,' and very coolly
proceeded to elongate the opposite end of its dwelling.
This operation did not last long; for in the
course of a few hours, on peering again into the
vessel, I saw that the humble and insignificant worm
had mustered up courage to 'face the enemy' once
more, and had, in fact, apparently conceived a new
idea, the wisdom of which was soon made palpable;
for slowly, but surely, most of the arenaceous particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
were eaten, and nothing being left but the pebble, it
was speedily and triumphantly ejected from the tube,
and the sand soon after employed for building purposes.
The Terebella having completed its laborious
and well-executed task, seemed to be quite exhausted,
and lay to all appearance lifeless for the succeeding
four and twenty hours.</p>

<p>When walking along the sandy beach, myriads of
peculiar objects may be seen swayed to and fro by
the roll of the waves. Frequently, when the tide
has receded, these tubes remain sticking out of the
sand to the height of two or three inches, each terminating
in a tuft, like the end of a piece of cord
that had been teazed out.</p>

<p>Within such a fragile habitation dwells the <i>Terebella
littoralis</i>, the most common species of the
marine tubiculous Annelids. I have very often
tried, by aid of my fingers only, or a strong spade, to
capture one of these creatures, but have never been
successful, even in a solitary instance. Yet several
authors tell their readers the task is perfectly easy.
Mr. Lewes, for instance, made me feel ashamed of
my previous manipulative efforts when I read his vivid
description of a Terebella hunt, and caused me lately
to journey a distance of six miles to try my hand
again, with no better result than hitherto.</p>

<p>I have lately seen a specimen of <i>T. littoralis</i>
which a friend of mine was so fortunate as to capture.
The tube of the animal, instead of being in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
its usual position, was situated in a pool, and offered
a most rare prize to its discoverer, it being the only
one he had ever caught. The tube, being of great
length, was cut down to about six inches and transferred
to a shallow glass tank, in which was introduced
some pounded shells. The beautiful Annelid
soon made itself at home, and commenced to repair
the damage done to its habitation by collecting these
particles, by means of its tentacula, which were
thrown out to an extraordinary distance in all directions.</p>

<p>The result of the animal's labours was soon apparent
by a most amusing white patch being added
to each end of its dark tube.</p>

<p>As soon as this operation was completed <i>mon
ami</i> carefully tore up the patched garment, and
ejected the defenceless Terebella into the vessel,
wherein was placed a piece of glass tube that
measured an inch in length. Strange to state,
the animal instantly crept into this object, and soon
made itself quite at home and comfortable. When
the building materials were placed near, they were
collected and <i>attached to each end of the glass
cylinder</i> by the little architect, who doubtless
was the first of its 'family' who could boast of
such a noble mansion,&mdash;which ultimately assumed a
very remarkable aspect from the variously-coloured
'mortar' that was employed in its construction.
Above and below the transparent centre came patches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of red, white, and blue material, composed respectively
of broken tile, pounded shells, and coloured
glass. Such a 'concourse of atoms' was surely
never before combined, either 'fortuitously' or otherwise,
in the construction of so common an object as
the tube of an Annelid.</p>

<p>The branchiæ of the above mentioned specimen
presented a most exquisite appearance, resembling
the perfect skeleton of a leaf, supposing that to be
dyed a brilliant crimson colour, and made to exhibit
incessant life-like motion even in its most delicate
and minute ramifications.</p>

<h2>XIII.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are certain narrow-minded persons who raise
objections to men of science prying into the secrets
of nature, and profanely, as they think, attempting
to explain the design and purpose of the great
Creator.</p>

<p>But to the intelligent and right thinking man, no
employment could be found more elevating or ennobling
than this; and whether he be a fellow-worker
himself, or merely an approving observer of
the labours of others, still he feels, and conscientiously
believes in the words of Milton, that&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>When such a one contemplates the atmosphere, for
instance, with its 'wonderful phenomena of clouds,
rain, and sunshine, that alternately shield, moisten,
and warm the face of the earth, he feels awed by
the grandeur of the exquisite system of machinery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
by which such beautiful results are accomplished.
To him also the sea, with its physical geography,
becomes as the main-spring of a watch; its waters,
and its currents, and its salts, and its inhabitants
with their adaptations, as balance wheels, cogs,
and pinions, and jewels. Thus he perceives that
they too are according to design; that they are
the expression of one thought, a unity with harmonies,
which one intelligence only could utter.' To
his eye all created things possess an interest doubly
great, not only from their marvellous structure, but
from the mission they are destined to fulfil in this
lower world.</p>

<p>What peculiar mission the Acalephæ (which we
are now about to consider) were destined to fulfil it
has long puzzled men of science to explain. Nor can
this be wondered at, when we remember the amazing
number of these creatures, and also the extreme delicacy
of their structure. Some indeed appear almost
as if they were formed by the sportive combination
of air and water, as if the sea-breeze ruffling the face
of ocean caused bubbles innumerable to arise, which
becoming mysteriously endowed with life, thenceforth
existed as Medusæ.</p>

<p>They have, indeed, frequently been spoken of as
'animated sea-water,' or 'living jelly.' These expressions
seem most appropriate when we remember,
that if one of these creatures be placed upon a plate
of glass, and allowed to remain exposed to the sun's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
rays, the only thing that will remain to testify to the
existence of this singularly graceful object is a thin
film, that a stroke of the sponge or finger will remove
in an instant.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory explanation that has been
offered as to the use and purpose of the Medusæ is,
that <i>they serve as the principal food of whales and
other Cetacea</i>. To these marine monsters&mdash;frequently
found from 70 to 110 feet long&mdash;we can imagine a
few hundreds of jelly-fish would be considered a small
meal. The supply, however, is ever equal to the
demand, as we shall see hereafter.</p>

<p>I may here be permitted to explain that, in most
large fishes, the jaws are completely filled with formidable
teeth, as in the shark, for instance. This
rapacious monster&mdash;which has been aptly termed the
tiger of the sea by us, and which the French, in allusion
to the deadly character of its habits, have named
Requin, or Requiem, the rest or stillness of death&mdash;possesses
a most marvellous dental apparatus.</p>

<p>Its teeth are not, as might be supposed, fixed in
sockets, but attached to a cartilaginous membrane.
The teeth, in fact, are placed one behind the other
in a series of rows; the first of which, composed
of triangular cutting teeth, stands erect and ready
for use. But as the membrane continues to grow
and advance forward, it slowly perishes, and the teeth
drop off, their place being taken by the next row
which formerly stood second. These, in the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of time, are succeeded by a third series, which are
again followed by others.</p>

<p>Now, whales possess no such weapons. Their
enormous mouths are not filled with 'tusks or
grinders, but fitted instead with vast numbers of
oblique laminæ of a softer substance, usually denominated
whalebone, which is admirably adapted for
the crushing and masticating of soft bodies.'</p>

<p>To give an idea of the amazing extent of the
harvests of 'whale food,' as the Medusæ are termed,
that abound in various parts of the ocean, we need only
quote the evidence of various navigators on the subject.
One (Lieut. Maury), for example, states, that
on the coast of Florida he met with a shoal of these
animals, that covered the sea for many leagues,
through which his vessel, bound for England, was
five or six days in passing. The most singular part
of the story is that, on his return some sixty days
after, he fell in with the same shoal off the Western
Islands, and here again he was three or four days
in getting clear of them.</p>

<p>The Western Islands here mentioned are, it seems,
the great resort for whales; and 'at first there is
something curious to us in the idea that the Gulf of
Mexico is the harvest field, and the Gulf Stream the
gleaner which collects the fruitage planted there, and
conveys it thousands of miles off to the living whales
at sea. But, perhaps, perfectly in unison is it with
the kind and providential care of that great, good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Being who feeds the young ravens when they cry,
and caters for the sparrow.'</p>

<p>But Dr. Scoresby, in his work on the Arctic Regions,
by aid of figures conveys the most vivid idea of the
myriads of these creatures that float in the bosom of
the ocean. This writer discovered that the olive-green
colour of the waters of the Greenland sea was
caused by the multitudes of jelly-fish contained
therein. On examination he found that 'they were
about one-fourth of an inch asunder. In this proportion
a cubic inch of water must contain 64; a
cubic foot, 110,592; a cubic fathom, 23,887,872;
and a cubical mile, 23,888,000,000,000,000! From
soundings made in the situation where these animals
were found, it is probable the sea is upwards of a
mile in depth; but whether these substances occupy
the whole depth is uncertain. Provided, however,
the depth which they extend be but 250 fathoms,
the above immense number of one species may occur
in a space of two miles square. It may give a better
conception of the amount of Medusæ in this extent,
if we calculate the length of time that would be
requisite with a certain number of persons for counting
this number. Allowing that one person could
count 1,000,000 in seven days, which is barely
possible, it would have required that 80,000 persons
should have started at the creation of the world to
complete the enumeration at the present time!
What a prodigious idea this fact gives of the immensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of creation, and of the bounty of Divine
Providence, in furnishing such a profusion of life in
a region so remote from the habitations of man.
But if the number of animals be so great in a space of
two miles square, what must be the amount requisite
for the discolouration of the sea through an extent
of perhaps 20,000, or 30,000 square miles.'</p>

<p>These creatures may be appropriately termed the
glow-worms of the ocean, for it is to them that the
phosphorescence of the sea is mainly attributable.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott, in his poem of the 'Lord of the
Isles,' thus alludes to this phenomenon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Awaked before the rushing prow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The mimic fires of ocean glow.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Those lightnings of the wave.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And, flashing round the vessel's sides,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">With elfish lustre lave;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While far behind their livid light<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the dark billows of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i8">A gloomy splendour gave.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Hugh Miller also gives a beautiful prose description
of the luminosity of our own seas, but we must
resist the temptation to introduce it here.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Greenland Seas is principally
owing to the presence of the minute species
of Acalephæ, but there are many others that grow
to an immense size. Specimens of these may be
frequently seen cast on the sea-beach by the force
of the waves. When in their native element they
form the swimmer's dread, owing to a peculiar stinging
power which they possess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>The Medusæ have been divided into groups, and
distinguished according to their different organs of
locomotion. The common idea is that all jelly-fishes
are like mushrooms or miniature umbrellas. Such,
it is true, is their general form, but others abound
both in our own and in foreign seas, that possess a
totally different appearance. For instance, some
move by means of numerous cilia, or minute hairs
that are attached to various parts of their bodies.
By the exercise of these organs the creatures glide
through the water, and hence they are called <i>ciliograde
Acalephæ</i>.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable examples of this class
is seen in the Girdle of Venus (<i>Cestum veneris</i>).
'This creature is a large, flat, gelatinous riband, the
margins of which are fringed with innumerable cilia,
tinted with most lively irridescent colours during the
day, and emitting in the dark a phosphorescent light
of great brilliancy. In this animal, too, which sometimes
attains the length of five or six feet, canals may
be traced running beneath each of the ciliated margins.'</p>

<p>This animal, as it glides rapidly along, has the
appearance of an undulating riband of flame. Most
likely it is the species to which Coleridge alludes in
the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Beyond the shadow of the ship<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I watched the water snakes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They moved in tracks of shining white,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And when they reared, the elfish light<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fell off in heavy flakes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Within the shadow of the ship<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I watched their rich attire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They curled and swam; and every track<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was a flash of golden fire.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another of this class is the common Beroë
(<i>Cydippe pileus</i>); its body is melon-shaped, and
covered over by rows or bands of cilia, placed
similarly to the treads on a water wheel, one above
another. These are entirely under the will of the
little gelatine. It can use each or all of them, and
thus row itself along at pleasure. But perhaps the
most singular portion of this creature is what has
been termed its fishing apparatus, though by some
writers it is considered merely to be the means by
which the Beroë anchors its body to any desired
spot. It consists of two exceedingly slender filaments
or streamers, which measure many times the
length of the Beroë itself. Some writers, again,
fancy that these organs are used to propel the
animal. This must be an erroneous notion, for if
they were cut off, the creature would still continue
to move with the same power as before. Nay more,
if the little Cydippe be cut into pieces, and the ciliated
bands be attached to each fragment, the latter will
swim about with the same power as when connected
with the entire animal.</p>

<p>From the filaments here described, others more
slender still depend at regular intervals, which curl
up like vine tendrils upon the principal stem. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
whole can be spontaneously elongated or slowly
withdrawn within the body of the Beroë, where
they lie enclosed in two sheaths until again required
for use.</p>

<p>These interior 'sheaths,' which resemble in shape
the drone of a bag-pipe, are easily seen, being almost
the only parts which are not perfectly transparent.
They are whitish in colour, and semiopaque.
(<a href="#Illus7">Plate 6 contains a sketch of the Beroë</a>,
drawn from nature.)</p>

<p>I may mention that the paddles, with their comb-like
array of cilia, flap successively in regular order
from the top to the bottom of each row. This
wave-like movement takes place simultaneously in all
the rows, when the animal is in full vigour.</p>

<p>The organs of progression in the <i>Pulmonigrade</i>
Acalephæ, as their name imports, bear certain resemblance
to the lungs in respiration. They move
by the expansion and contraction of their umbrella-shaped
bodies. Graceful and elegant indeed are the
motions of these creatures. I have seen small specimens
about the size of a sixpence, advance, in three
springs, from the bottom to the top of a large vase in
which they were confined.</p>

<p>In descending they turn over and allow themselves
to sink gradually as if by their own weight.</p>

<p>The third division of the Acalephæ is termed
<i>Physograde</i>. The most common member of this
group is the <i>Physalus</i>, so well known to all sailors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
under the name of the Portuguese Man-of-War. It
is buoyed up by air bladders&mdash;in fact, its entire
body appears as one bladder, which the animal is
enabled to contract or expand at will. At first
glance the <i>Physalus</i> appears to belong to quite a
different family&mdash;suffering under some maltreatment;
for from its lower side, what seem a number of
entrails, of all shapes and sizes, hang down. When
the upper surface or crest of its swimming bladder
projects above the waves, it has a beautiful appearance,
spangled with rays of purple, blue, and gold.
This formation acts as a kind of sail, by means of
which the creature is enabled to glide along with
considerable speed.</p>

<p>This Physalus is a somewhat mysterious being,
and zoologists have not as yet been able to determine
many points connected with its structure and development.</p>

<p>The <i>Cirrigrade</i> Acalephæ, too, are a singular
family. They exhibit a higher stage of development
than those already alluded to, and possess a kind of
skeleton embedded within their gelatinous bodies.</p>

<p>The <i>Porpita</i> and <i>Velella</i> are examples of this
class, but for detailed descriptions I must refer the
reader to larger works which treat on the subject.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this brief and imperfect sketch
of the Acalephæ without noticing their singular mode
of reproduction. Nothing can appear more marvellous
than this process when first brought before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
one's attention. It far excels the wildest dreams of
fiction; and were it not so well authenticated by
naturalists who have devoted labour and valuable time
to gain ocular demonstration of the fact, we might
well hesitate to believe the statements laid before us
in their works.</p>

<p>For example, a Polype, as <i>Hydra Gelatinosa</i> or
<i>Hydra Tuba</i>(found on buoys, oyster shells, &amp;c., long
submerged), will, it may be in a simple aquarium,
produce a number of small objects which, on being
examined through the microscope, are found to be,
not young Polypes, but Jelly-fish! In process
of time, the latter, by a wondrous law of nature,
will produce in their turn, not Medusæ, but
Polypes!</p>

<p>'Imagine,' says Mr. Lewes, 'a lily producing a
butterfly, and the butterfly in turn producing a lily,
and you would scarcely invent a marvel greater than
this production of Medusæ was to its first discoverers.
Nay, the marvel most go further still, the lily must
first produce a whole bed of lilies like its own fair
self before giving birth to the butterfly, and this
butterfly must separate itself into a crowd of butterflies,
before giving birth to the lily.'</p>

<p>Let me now, by entering briefly into detail,
endeavour to make the reader acquainted with the
leading features of this mysterious subject, known as
'the alternation of generations.'</p>

<p>The adult Medusæ, then, gives birth to a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of oval gemmæ or buds, appropriately so called by
most writers, which appear like minute jelly bubbles,
covered with numberless vibratile cilia. These
organs, ten thousand times more delicate, we may
imagine, than the eyelashes of some infant member of
fairy land, are ever in constant motion. The currents
produced thereby serve to propel the little
animal to some stray pebble or stalk of sea-weed,
situated at a respectful distance from its gelatinous
relative. On some such object the young bud
attaches itself, and proceeds to vegetate.</p>

<p>The body gradually lengthens, and becomes enlarged
at its upper extremity; from this portion of the
animal four arms appear surrounding a kind of
mouth. The arms lengthen, and are soon joined by
four others. These organs, as also the inner surface
of the lips and of the stomach, are covered with cilia,
and become highly sensitive. They are used in the
same manner as the tentacula of the Actiniæ, namely,
for the capture of food. There is this difference, be
it observed, between the two animals, that while the
infant Medusæ labours incessantly to gain its daily
meals, the zoophyte remains still, and trusts to chance
for every meal that it enjoys.</p>

<p>Fresh sets of arms continue to be developed successively
upon the little jelly fish, until the whole
amount in number to twenty-five or thirty. 'And the
body, originally about the size of a grain of sand, becomes
a line, or the twelfth part of an inch in length.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus far there appears nothing particularly striking
or improbable in the history of the Medusæ; the
next stage, however, exhibits matter for our 'special
wonder.'</p>

<p>The young Acaleph now throws off its animal
existence, and sinks into a plant or compound polype.</p>

<p>The lower part of the body swells, and from
thence, what may be termed a <i>stolen</i>, is thrown out.
On the upper surface of the stolen one and even two
buds are often formed. 'As the bud enlarges it becomes
elongated, and bends itself downwards to reach
the surface of the stone to which the elongated extremity
adheres; after this the attached end is
gradually separated from the body of the parent.
When thus detached, a small opening presents itself
at its upper end, its interior gradually becomes
hollowed out, and cilia grow upon it, and tentacula
begin to sprout around the mouth, exactly in the
same manner as in the buds formed on the upper
surface of the stolens.'</p>

<p>Thus, from a single bud numberless other buds
are formed, each being endowed with equally prolific
powers. If the parent be cut in half transversely,
the cut will close in, attach itself to some object, and
produce stolens and buds! If cut longitudinally, and
the cut edges be allowed to touch each other, they
will again adhere, and exhibit no trace of their ever
having been divided. If the cut edges of each
division be not kept apart they will approximate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
adhere together, and thus two separate animals will
be produced, each gifted with the power of throwing
out stolens and buds with the same prodigality as if
they had never been disunited!</p>

<p>How long this budding process of necessity continues
we cannot tell. It may be only during the
winter season. These creatures in their perfect condition
are generally found crowding our seas during
the summer months; most probably, therefore, as
Sars and Steenstrup state, it is at the commencement
of spring that they undergo the last portion of this
'transformation strange.'</p>

<p>Still, this cannot be taken as a general rule. Dr.
Reid, who for a period of two years kept colonies of
Medusæ, and assiduously watched the various stages
of their development, found that the larvæ of one
colony, which was obtained in September 1845, did
not split transversely into young Medusæ in the
spring of 1846, as he expected them to do, but continued
to produce stolens and buds abundantly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the larvæ of the other colonies,
which this gentleman obtained in July, began to
yield young Medusæ about the middle of March.
This process takes place in the following manner:
A 'bud' having arrived at maturity, it becomes
'cylindrical,' considerably elongated, and much diminished
in diameter, its outer surface being marked
with a series of transverse wrinkles.</p>

<p>These wrinkles, or rings, which frequently amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to thirty or forty in number, are first formed at the
top, and slowly extend downwards. Gradually as
these furrows become deeper, the tentacula waste
away, and upon the margin of the upper ring eight
equi-distant rays are formed. The process continuing,
in the space of a fortnight or so each groove or
ring is in like manner furnished with rays. The
Medusæ now present an appearance exactly resembling
a series of cups piled up one within the other.
Strange to state, each little cup becomes eventually
endowed with life! As the uppermost segment is
completely developed, it rests upon the slender lips
of the one beneath. It then glides off from its old
resting-place, and swims freely about in the water.
Quickly it aspires to the rippling surface above, and
by a series of graceful evolutions accomplishes its
object. Once among the dancing waves and exposed
to the rays of a cheering sun, our little Medusa
assumes its complete form; and as a beautiful <i>Modecra
formosa</i>, it may be destined at some time or other
to be the prize of an ardent zoologist, who, I
venture to assert, could not compliment it in more
poetical language than Professor Forbes has already
done. This delightful author, describing the little
gem in question, says, 'It is gorgeous enough to be
the diadem of sea fairies, and sufficiently graceful to
be the night-cap of the tiniest and prettiest of mermaidens.'
Or as an adult <i>Cyanea capillata</i>, our
once insignificant jelly-bag may perhaps appear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
by an exercise of its urticating powers, send some
unhappy swimmer smarting and trembling to his
home.</p>

<p>While the Medusæ column proceeds to throw off
from its uppermost part living segments of itself,
its lower half, or stem, continues to grow, but does
not become ringed, for as the budding process ceases,
the last formed cup rests on newly-formed tentacula!
Then again stolens are thrown out, on which young
Medusæ are formed, as before described.</p>

<p>Contemplating such mysteries as these, the mind
becomes bewildered and the spirits humbled.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Imagination wastes its strength in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And fancy tries and turns within itself,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Struck with the amazing depths of Deity.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The above may be deemed one of the most interesting
zoological theories that has ever been promulgated
in modern times. It was founded by Chamisso,
and termed the 'alternation of generation,' but was
much improved and extended by the researches of
Steenstrup. Professor Owen, however, had previously
reduced the theory to a fixed and definite
scientific form, under the title of '<i>Parthenogenesis</i>.'
Another author, not viewing the Medusæ in the
various stages of development as an aggregation of
individuals, 'in the same sense that one of the higher
animals is an individual,' proposes that each Medusa
be considered as an individual, developed into so
many 'zooids.'</p>

enter. The reader who would wish to know more of
the subject than I have faintly shadowed forth in this
chapter, may consult Steenstrup's Memoir, published
by the Ray Society; Dr. Reid's admirable papers in

'Sea-Side Studies;' and the learned works of Professor
Owen.</p>

<h2>XIV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> fine morning during the month of January, on
peering into my largest tank I perceived, attached to
the upper portion of the marble arch (centre piece),
a peculiar object that had evidently been deposited
during the preceding night, but by whom or by what
means I knew not. It resembled a fungoid growth,
or riband of flesh, plaited up and attached at one
edge to the stone. At every undulation of the water
the object moved to and fro with an extremely
graceful motion.</p>

<p>By careful and close examination it was seen to
be covered with a film, that gradually expanded
until it burst, and thus gave means of escape to
thousands of minute white granules. On submitting
these to the microscope, a most wondrous sight met
my astonished eyes. Each dot or granule proved to
be a transparent shell, resembling the periwinkle or
rather the nautilus in shape; containing an animal
whose excited and rapid movements were amusing to
witness. From out the opening of the shell appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
now and again two rings of cilia. When these
organs were about to be put into action, they reminded
me of two circular tubes of gas connected
together, and each containing innumerable perforations,
which were sometimes suddenly and entirely
lit up by a torch being applied to one end.</p>

<p>The <i>cilia</i> may be distinctly seen to play at a certain
point, and then gradually extend round the circumference
of the rings. When the whole are in
full action their movements are so extremely swift
<i>as to appear devoid of motion</i>, and thus bear a resemblance
to rings of flame.</p>

<p>The result of the movements of the cilia was always
evident in the vigorous evolutions of the little embryos,
for the microscope filaments, while in action,
caused the animal to roll about in all directions in a
confined circle. When this envelope burst, the little
nautiline dashed out, and then&mdash;then it was of little
use attempting to get a view of the animal again, so
rapid and violent were its movements to and fro,
never resting for one instant on any spot, and least
of all the spot wished. By the aid of blotting-paper,
I sometimes reduced the quantity of water in
the watch glass; and the animal, thus being compelled
to confine its evolutions to a narrower stage, was more
often within the field of view.</p>

<p>On visiting the sea-shore shortly after the discovery
of the egg cluster just described, I perceived
attached to numberless stones and large boulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
thick clusters, composed of the self-same objects!
Beside them were lying confused heaps of <i>sea-slugs</i>,
evidently exhausted with their hatching exertions.
Anything more repulsive to the eye than those
animal heaps exhibited it would be difficult to conceive.
Yet, at the same time, I know of no sight
more pleasing than to watch the <i>Doris</i> in its healthy
state, gliding along with outspread plume on the
under surface of the water, or up the sides of the
tank, more especially if it be observed through a
powerful hand lens.</p>

<p>These remarks will perhaps convey some new information
to the young naturalist, embracing as they
do the leading facts connected with the wondrous
embryotic development of many marine animals.
The reader will already be prepared to learn that the
vivacious little animal, moving by aid of cilia and
enclosed in a <i>shell</i>, was in reality the youthful stage
of that slow creeping gasteropod the <i>Doris</i>, which, in
its mature form, is possessed of no cilia, nor any
shelly covering whatever.</p>

<p>I should not have introduced this subject so
familiarly did I not feel anxious to make my readers
aware how easy it is for each of them to conduct
experiments in the early stages of embryotic development,
and to gain practical evidence of the wonders
which this study unfolds.</p>

<p>'What,' eloquently asks Mr. Lewes, 'can be more
interesting than to watch the beginnings of life, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
trace the gradual evolution of an animal from a mass
of cells, each stage in the evolution presenting not
only its own characteristics, but those marks of
affinity with other animals which make the whole
world kin? To watch the formation of the blood-vessels,
to see the heart first begin its tremulous
pulsations, to note how life is from the first one
incessant struggle and progress&mdash;these keep us with
fascinated pertinacity at our studies.'</p>

<p>The remarkable fact above mentioned, of the
young of the Nudibranchiate Gasteropoda being
furnished with a shell is exhibited not only in
Doris, but in Eolis, Tritonia, Aplysia, &amp;c., while the
embryos of the Purpura, Nerita, Trochus, &amp;c., are
likewise in their youthful state furnished with cilia,
by the agency of which these animals swim freely
about in their native element.</p>

<p>There is one exception to this, which occurs in
<i>Chiton</i>, the early stage of which has recently been
shown by the observations of Mr. Clarke and Professor
Loven to be peculiar, and more resembling
that of an annelid than of a mollusc. In this case
the animal can scarcely be said to undergo a metamorphosis;
for the embryo, even within the egg,
has nearly the form of the parent, and the appearance
of the shell-plates is a mere matter of development.</p>

<p>I have never attempted to count the ova that
were contained in any single riband of Doris spawn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
in fact I considered the task an impossibility; but
at a rough calculation, I concluded there would not
be less than a million. Dr. Darwin, however,
travelling in the Falkland Isles, met with a riband
of spawn from a white Doris (the animal itself was
three and a half inches long), which measured twenty
inches in length, and half an inch in breadth! and
by counting how many balls were contained in a
tenth of an inch in the row, and how many rows in
an equal length of riband, this gentleman reckoned
that upon a moderate computation there could not
be less than six millions of eggs. Yet, in spite of
such amazing fecundity, this Doris was not common.
'Although,' says Dr. Darwin, 'I was searching under
the stones, I saw only seven individuals. No fallacy
is more common with naturalists, than that the
numbers of an individual species depend on its
powers of propagation.'</p>

<p>This apparent paradox is not difficult of explanation
when we consider the number of enemies which
are always hovering near, and ready with hungry
mouths to snap up the infant embryos as soon as
they begin to show signs of vitality. The Hermit-Crabs
are especially fond of Doris spawn, so much
so, indeed, that the writer could never retain any
for hatching purposes while any of the Paguri were
near. Mr. Peach says they (the young Dorides)
have myriads of enemies in the small <i>Infusoria</i>,
which may be noticed, with a powerful microscope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
hovering round them, and ready to devour them the
instant weakness or injury prevents their keeping in
motion the cilia, which serve both for locomotion
and defence. Let them cease to move, a regular
attack is made, and the animal is soon devoured;
and it is interesting to observe several of the scavengers
sporting with the empty shell, as if in derision
of the havoc they have made.</p>

<p>The same difficulty of calculation does not exist,
at least to any such extent, with the spawn of Eolis,
which is laid in stringy coils. M. Gosse mentions
a specimen of <i>E. papillosa</i> that laid nine strings of
spawn in his tank between the 20th of March and
the 24th of May, all as nearly as possible of the
same length. Each string contained about a hundred
convolutions, each convolution about two hundred
ova, and each ova including, on an average, two
embryos, making a total progeny of forty thousand,
produced from one parent in little more than two
months.</p>

<p>I may mention that on no occasion have I ever
found the spawn coils of either Doridiæ or Eolididæ
in my tanks, or at the sea-shore, except during the
months of January and February or March; neither
have any of my specimens spawned more than once
during an entire season. From noticing the same
group of parent slugs congregated, and remaining, as
I can affirm, for weeks near their egg clusters, evidently
in a most enfeebled condition, it has occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to me that on the Frith of Forth, at least, vast
numbers of these animals do not long survive the
hatching season.</p>

<p>Whether this be the case or not, it is a most
singular fact that in this locality, a Doris more than
one or two inches in length is scarcely ever to be
met with.</p>

<p>There is at present in one of my tanks a specimen
of the Doris of a pearly-white colour, a second, tinted
white and pink, and two others which are quite
<i>black</i>,&mdash;all being procured from the coast near Edinburgh.
The last-mentioned animals are, I think,
somewhat uncommon. When watching one of them
in motion while the sun is shining down upon it,
the hue of the creature changes from a black to a
very deep purple, owing, no doubt, to its fleshy disc
being many shades lighter than its body, which,
being extended, and exhibited under a full glow of
light, becomes semi-transparent. This peculiarity is
not evident, of course, when the Doris is lying in a
passive state, with all its gill-plumes closed up.</p>

<p>This sombre-coated gasteropod, although rare in
some localities, is very plentiful in foreign parts, if
the following may be received as an accurate narrative.
'On a reef of rocks near the island of Raiatea
is a huge unshapely black or brown slug, here called
'<i>Biche</i>,' from six to seven inches long, and five to
six broad. Is is caught in vast quantities, and not
only regarded as a great delicacy by the natives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
but being cured, has become a valuable article of
commerce in the China market, whither it is carried
from many insular coasts of the Pacific by American
ships. We have seen a number of lads fill three
canoes in two hours with these sea-snails.'</p>

<p>Thus uninviting as this slimy animal seems to
our English taste, there is evidently no doubt of its
being used by the Chinese as an article of food, and
according to the evidence of certain authors, is
esteemed by the 'barbarians' a high-class luxury;
but then we must remember that the inhabitants of
the land of gongs and chopsticks, have always been
famed for their singular gastronomic tastes. One
poet writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'That man had sure a palate covered o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With brass or steel, that, on the rocky shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">First broke the oozy oyster's pearly coat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And risked the living morsel down his throat.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, 'Mandarins and Pigtails,' what was such <i>risk</i>,
I ask, compared to that which <i>he</i> endured, who
swallowed the first mouthful of birds'-nest soup? or
horror of horrors, the first spoonful of sea-snail stew?
Yet we are told that both the 'mucilage' and the
<i>Bêches de Mer</i> dishes are savoury and highly grateful
to the palate of an appreciating gourmand.</p>

<p>A recent author, describing a Chinese dinner from
personal observation, tells us, that when the first
dish, composed of birds'-nest soup, was over, he
waited the advent of the next course with very
nervous excitement.  'It was a stew of sea-slugs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
They are slippery, and very difficult to be handled
by inexperienced chopsticks; but they are most
pleasant and succulent food, not at all unlike in
flavour to the green fat of the turtle. If a man cannot
eat anything of a kind whereof he has not seen
his father and grandfather eat before him, we must
leave him to his oysters, and his periwinkles, and
his craw-fish, and not expect him to swallow the
much more comely sea-slug. But surely a Briton,
who has eaten himself into a poisonous plethora
upon mussels, has no right to hold up his hands and
eyes at a Chinaman enjoying his honest, well-cooked
stew of <i>Bêches de Mer</i>.</p>

<p>'During the discussion of this dish our Chinese
master of the ceremonies solemnly interposed. We
were neglecting the rudiments of politeness, no one
had offered to intrude one of these sleek and savoury
delicacies, deeply rolled in sauce, into the mouth of
his neighbour. Efforts were made to retrieve the
barbarian honour, but with no great success, for the
slugs were <i>evasive</i>, and the proffered mouthful was
not always welcome.'</p>

<h2>XV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> been observing for several days the movements
of a Common Shore-Crab, which has been
almost all his life under my protection. Although
his present dimensions would render such a feat impossible,
when first I shook the little fellow off a
bunch of <i>C. officinalis</i>, he could have crawled with
the greatest of ease into the mouth of a small popgun.
We all know that members of this family are
bold and daring in their attacks upon their weaker
neighbours; upon each and all they wage a constant
predatory warfare. The poor Pholades, however, are
the favourite objects of their attacks. On these
innocent bivalves the Crustacea successfully prey,
unless they are protected by their usual rock-bound
citadel, which, of course, they cannot always be. In
order to watch the Pholas at work, it is necessary that
the siphons should be more or less protruding from his
tubular dwelling. If supported, say, to the full depth
of his valves, the animal is secure; for I notice that
neither crab nor fish can tear away the gristly ends of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the siphonal appendages when withdrawn; and when
disturbed, the poor Pholas leaves only this part in
view. I have frequently seen the Fiddler-Crab
embrace a Pholas in his claws, and struggle to pull
him from his seat. On one occasion this operation was
performed successfully, much to my annoyance, as I
had been at some trouble to saw the rock away in
order to watch easily every movement of the animal
within. At night when I looked into the tank my
pet was safe; next morning it was wedged under
some pebbles, and the crab was feasting leisurely
upon his tender flesh.</p>

<p>It is most amusing to watch the Blennies, too,
attack a Pholas, cast into the tank, and to witness
their mode of pecking at and shaking their victim,
and turning innumerable somersaults with it in their
mouths. The strength they exhibit in these man&oelig;uvres
is perfectly astounding.</p>

<p>About two hours after they had received one
of their favourite 'muttons' to feast upon, I peeped
into the aquarium, and found, as I expected, the
Blennies hard at their work of destruction. Behind
them, among some bushy tufts of <i>I. edulis</i>, the little
crab, before alluded to, was seated. In his arms he
held an object unlike anything I had seen on sea or
land. It appeared like a slender stick of beautifully
iridescent opal. My amazement at this sight may
readily be conceived, for I had not the remotest idea
as to how he had become possessed of such a prize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day I placed another devoted Pholas in the
tank, and after a while looked in to see how its
finny enemies were conducting themselves, when,
what should meet my eye, but the crab, sneaking off
with another opal baton in his arms! I was more
puzzled than ever. It was quite certain that the
object in question had been procured from the Pholas,
yet I had not heard of, or ever seen anything like it
in that animal.</p>

<p>I was 'on thorns' until next day, so that I
might by watching solve the mystery. A third
Pholas was flung into the den. The fishes, eager as
usual, instantly attacked and pulled the mollusc to
pieces. After a while the crab began to move about
to and fro, evidently very restless, and anxious for
my departure. I did retire, but only to such distance
as would allow me a distinct view of his movements.
In a few moments he stepped out mincingly
on the tips of his toes, and crossed the tank to the
spot where the poor Pholas lay, like some fine beau
in Queen Anne's reign tripping jauntily down the
Mall, or across St. James' Park, to feed the ducks in
Rosamond's Pond.</p>

<p>The Blennies darted off at his approach. He
then seated himself before the mangled corpse, and
scraped at it vigorously, manifestly searching for
some coveted treasure. Shortly after, perceiving
him clutch at something, I quickly approached and
disturbed his movements&mdash;took up the Pholas, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
my surprise found, on drawing out an object that
protruded from the foot of the animal, that I possessed
the pearly and gelatinous cylinder, such as the crab
had twice before devoured with such evident relish.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It was plain then that the little rascal had become
so dainty, that he 'turned up his nose,' or rather his
'pair of noses,' at what is vulgarly termed the 'first
cut,' and condescended only upon the tit-bits, for his
marine banquet. So his crabship, in order to save
himself trouble, actually waited until the fishes had
cut up the Pholas to a certain point, when he would
rush forward and seize on his favourite fare.</p>

<p>Some of my readers will doubtless remember the
anecdote of the crossing sweeper, whose idiosyncrasy
led him to covet diurnally a mutton-chop situated
in the middle of the loin. My Lady Pepys, or Mr.
Saccharine, the great grocer, couldn't always procure
the desired 'cut!' <i>n'importe</i> the knight of the besom
met with no such disappointment.</p>

<p>This individual's place of business was luckily situated
opposite to a noted butcher's shop, which
circumstance easily enabled him to watch until, from
the demands of sundry customers, the perspective of
the loin, which lay temptingly upon the chopping
block, had become adapted to his point of sight.
He would then step in and meekly order a simple
pound avoirdupois. With this <i>bonne-bouche</i> carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
packed in his pocket, he would again mount
guard, and remain until night. At dusk of evening
he shut up shop,&mdash;that is, he swept the dirt over
the parallel path that he had all day kept scrupulously
clean, and then marched off to enjoy his dinner
at a fashionable hour, in private.</p>

<p>Are not these cases palpably alike? Passing by
certain details, were not the pawkiness and cunning
of the epicurean beggar fully equalled by our diminutive
friend, <i>C. mænas</i>?</p>

<p>'But,' you ask, 'what then was the opal stick?'
Ay, there's the rub, for even the greatest naturalists
cannot positively agree as to the use and purpose of
this mysterious organ. Yet it is to be found (as we
have seen) in the foot of the Pholas, in the Mussel,
the Cockle; and, in fact, it occurs in almost all bivalves
both great and small. It is termed the 'hyaline cylindrical
stylet,' and is very <i>lucidly</i> and scientifically
described as 'an elastic spring to work the corneous
plate or attritor, and by the muscular action of the foot
and body, to divide and comminute the food, and especially
the minute crustaceous and testaceous alimentary
matters received into the stomachial cavity.
It appears then that this appendage acts as <i>a gizzard</i>,
and the bivalve mollusca are thus supplied with a
masticatory apparatus very analogous to the gizzards
of some of the gasteropoda.'</p>

<p>Now, the simple fact that I have stated above,
of the hyaline stylet being found in the <i>foot</i>, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in the stomach, at once proves that it cannot possibly
act as a <i>gizzard</i> to the Pholas, or any other bivalve
in which it is known to exist.</p>

<p>In the succeeding chapter I shall endeavour, from
personal observation, to shed a slender ray of light
upon the function of the stylet.</p>

<h2>XVI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> certain parts of the Scottish coast, the 'dykes,'
or walls built near the road-side, are constructed
entirely of rough-hewn pieces of hard sandstone rock,
brought from the neighbouring shore. Sometimes a
dyke will extend for two or three miles, without
presenting an isolated fragment, in which the honeycomb-like
perforations of certain species of the boring
Mollusca are not more or less apparent.</p>

<p>A fragment of soft sandstone lies before me, measuring
three and a half inches in length, and two inches in
breadth, which, small though it be, contains no fewer
than seventeen cylindrical tunnels. Each of these
exhibits so wonderful a skill in construction, that
human hands could not surpass it, though aided by
'all the means and appliances to boot,' of mechanical
agency.</p>

<p>It is generally stated that the Pholas never intrudes
itself into the apartment occupied by a neighbouring
'worker.' The Pholas, however, often intrudes
on its neighbour; and such intrusion is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
manifested in the small piece of stone alluded to in
no less than four instances. Here let me observe,
that it is not always the larger mollusc that bores
through the smaller one; it as frequently happens
that the latter deserves the brand of wanton aggressor.
Both cases are common enough, and, indeed, must of
necessity occur, wherever at any time a colony of
various sized Pholades are clustered together in a
small portion of rock.</p>

<p>A fragment of rock riddled by the Pholas is a
much more pleasing sight than can be witnessed at
the sea-shore in connection with that animal under
usual circumstances. For this reason: When visiting
the habitat of the boring bivalves, a host of small
circular holes are sometimes seen; at other times the
surface of the same portion of the beach appears
comparatively sound, and it is only by striking a
smart blow with a hammer upon the ground, that
we render scores of orifices instantly observable in
all directions, from each of which is thrown a small
jet of water. This phenomenon is caused by the
Pholades in alarm retracting their siphons, which had
hitherto filled the entire extent of the tunnels. At
such a locality, if a piece of rock be excavated, various
specimens of these boring molluscs, shrunk to their
smallest possible size, will be discovered at the base
of the cavities, which are invariably of a conical
form, tapered at the top, and gradually enlarging as
they descend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be evident, then, that neither the likeness
of the animal, nor the formation of its singular
dwelling-place, can be seen by the casual wanderer
along the sea-shore.</p>

<p>It will also be apparent to the intelligent reader,
that when once the Pholas is located in a certain
spot, he becomes a tenant for life; for never by any
chance whatever, can the poor miner leave his rocky
habitation by his own unaided exertions, even were
he so inclined. As he grows older and increases in
size, nature teaches the animal to enlarge his habitation
in a proportionate and suitable manner.</p>

<p>During the period of the boring process, the orifice
becomes clogged above the shell with the <i>debris</i>
of the rock, and this, if allowed to accumulate would
speedily asphyxiate the animal. To get rid of such
an unpleasant obstruction, the Pholas retracts, and
closes the end of its siphons, then suddenly extends
the 'double barrelled' tube to its full length, until it
reaches the entrance of the tunnel. This movement
often repeated, causes portions of the pulverized stone
to be forced outwards at each operation.</p>

<p>It is interesting to watch the curious manner in
which the end of the principal siphon is alternately
closed and spread out when it reaches the water,
like a man inspiring heavily after any unusual exertion;
it is then made again to descend, and renew
its task, as above described.</p>

<p>In extracting that portion of the <i>debris</i> which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
deposited at the <i>base</i> of the cavity, below the body
of the industrious miner, a different plan is adopted.
Wherever a Pholas is at its labours, there are always
deposited within a circumference of several inches
round the tunnel, myriads of short thin threads,
which are squirted out from the smaller siphon.</p>

<p>The nodules on examination are found to be composed
of pulverized rock, which is drawn in at the
pedal opening, and ejected in the above manner,
thereby effectually clearing the lower portion of the
orifice. It was suggested to me that these threadlike
objects were the f&oelig;cal matters of the Pholas,
but this idea was soon dispelled by the assistance of
the microscope; and, moreover, from the fact that
the threads are never visible when the animal is in a
quiescent state, but only when it is busily engaged
in its mysterious task of boring.</p>

<p>I was for some time puzzled to find any aperture
in connection with the club-like foot of the Pholas
(<i>P. crispata</i>), although several of the bivalves were
sacrificed to the cause of science. But what the
microscope and scalpel in this instance failed to unfold,
attentive watching of the animal in the aquarium
made palpably apparent, in the following manner.</p>

<p>I had on one occasion captured about a dozen
Pholades, some of which were embedded in the solid
rock, others detached.</p>

<p>The first mentioned, I knew would be quite safe
among the blennies and crabs, from the untempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and unedible nature of their siphonal tubes. Very
different was the case with the defenceless, disentombed
specimens. These were intended as food for
their finny companions, who happened to be particularly
fond of a change of diet. My 'pack' had
subsisted for some time on Mussels, and on such
excellent food, had become impudent, corpulent, and
dainty. But overgorged epicures though they were,
I knew that although everything else failed, a 'real
live' Pholas placed before them would serve to
speedily whet their appetites.</p>

<p>A splendid specimen of the siphoniferous bivalve
was dropped into the tank, the base of which it had
no sooner reached, than the fishes, with eager eyes
and watering mouths, came hovering like a flock of
vultures round the welcome meal thus unexpectedly
placed before them.</p>

<p>One rascal, who seemed to be cock of the walk,
came forward and made the first grip at the delicate
fleshy foot, that in appearance was as white as a
newly fallen snowflake. The pedal organ was, of
course, instantly and forcibly withdrawn, so much so,
indeed, as to be almost hidden from view, except at
its extreme base. In this position it remained for
several seconds. When the finny gourmand again
boldly advanced to take a second mouthful, to my
intense surprise he was, apparently, blown to a distance
of several inches. I could scarcely credit the
evidence of my senses.  Another and another of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
fishes were in their turn served in like manner as
their leader. In a short time, however, the poor
mollusc failed to repulse his enemies, and finally fell
a passive victim to their gluttonous propensities.</p>

<p>Now comes the important question, 'How is the
boring operation performed?' How can this simple
animal, with its brittle shell, and soft fleshy body,
manage to perforate the sandstone, or other hard
substances, in which it lives?</p>

<p>For hundreds of years this query has been asked,
and various are the replies which from time to time
have been given. Singular to state, although specimens
of the Pholas, and its allies the Saxicavæ, are
to be procured in abundance in many parts of the
kingdom, the subject is not even yet positively
settled.</p>

<p>There have been many theories advanced, some the
result of fancy or guess-work; others, of practical
study. All these have their supporters, but none have,
by common consent, been adopted by physiologists
as the true one.</p>

<p>Having for several years made this subject a
study of personal observation, I believe I may venture
to state, that I have succeeded in casting a
feeble ray of light upon it; and, although the result
of my labours may not be deemed conclusive, I may
at least claim some credit for my endeavours to clear
up a most difficult, though deeply interesting point
in natural history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The various theories promulgated on this knotty
point are generally classed under five heads: 1st,
That the animal secretes a chemical solvent&mdash;an acid&mdash;which
dissolves the substance in which it bores.
2d, That the combined action of the secreted solvent,
and rasping by the valves, effects the perforations.
3d, That the holes are made by rasping
effected by silicious particles studding the
substance of certain parts of the animal. 4th,
That currents of water, set in action by the
motions of vibratile cilia, are the agents. 5th, and
lastly, That the boring mollusca perforate by means
of the rotation of their shells, which serve as
augurs.</p>

<p>Of all the above, the first which is quite a fancy
theory, seems to meet with greatest favour among
certain naturalists. But as it is rather puzzling to
find a chemical solvent, which will act equally upon
sandstone, clay, chalk, wax, and wood, this hypothesis
can only be looked upon by practical men as ingenious,
but incorrect. Even were it proved that
the animal really possessed the power of secreting
an acid sufficiently powerful, the question naturally
arises, How can the shell escape being affected in
like manner with the much harder substance in
which it is situated?</p>

<p>The second theory, or the combined action of rasping
and the secreted solvent, is, for obvious reasons,
equally objectionable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The third theory, which endeavours to account for
the wearing away of the rock by means of silicious
particles situated in the foot and other parts of the
animal, has been for some time proved to be erroneous,
from the fact, that the combined skill of some
of our best anatomists and microscopists has
failed to discover the slightest presence of any
particles of silex in the Pholadidæ, although these
are believed to exist in other families of the boring
acephala.</p>

<p>The fourth theory, that of ciliary currents as an
accessory agent in boring, is worthy of greater consideration,
chiefly from the evidence we possess of
the immense power which the incessant action of
currents of water possess in wearing away hard substances.</p>

<p>We come now to what may be considered the
most important of the theories above enumerated,
viz., the mechanical action of the valves of the Pholas
in rasping away the rock, &amp;c. This hypothesis is
one which most naturally suggests itself to the mind
of any impartial person, on examining, for instance,
the rasp-like exterior of the shell of <i>Pholas crispata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
But as I shall endeavour to show, although the shell
forms the principal, it does not by any means constitute
the <i>sole</i> agent in completing the perforating
process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Clark, a clever naturalist, considers with Mr.
Hancock that the powerfully armed ventral portion
of the <i>mantle</i> of the closed boring acephala is fully
adequate to rub down their habitations, and that the
theories of mechanical boring, solvents, and ciliary
currents, are so utterly worthless and incapable of
producing the effects assigned to them, as not to be
worth dwelling upon for one moment. Mr. Clark,
therefore, comes to the conclusion that 'the foot is
the true and sole terebrating agent in the Pholas.'
This 'fact' he considers to be 'incontestably proved,'
for the following reason, viz., because he had discovered
specimens of this bivalve with the foot entirely
obliterated,&mdash;which phenomenon, Mr. Clark
states, is caused by the animal having arrived at its
full growth, at which period the terebrating functions
cease; and as 'nature never permanently retains
what is superfluous,' the foot is supposed gradually
to wither away, and finally disappear.</p>

<p>This, I suspect, is another 'fancy' theory. Although
I have excavated hundreds of Pholades, some
of giant-like proportions, it has never been my lot to
witness the foot otherwise than in a healthy and fully
developed condition.</p>

<p>Another writer, having no opportunity of viewing
the living animal, does not consider it difficult to
imagine the Pholas 'licking a hole' with its foot,
from the fact that he (Mr. Sowerby) managed to
make 'a sensible impression' upon a piece of kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
hearthstone. 'I had,' he says, 'not patience to carry
the experiment any further, but as far as it went, it
left no doubt on my mind that, with the foot alone,
and without any silicious particles, without a chemical
solvent, and without using the rasping power of its
shell, our little animal could easily execute his self-pronounced
sentence of solitary confinement for life.'</p>

<p>Such an inconclusive statement as this would, I
feel certain, never have been penned, had its author
been so fortunate as to have had opportunity of
watching a Pholas at work.</p>

<p>But, as Professor Owen truly observes, 'Direct observation
of the boring bivalves in the act of perforation
has been rarely enjoyed, and the instruments
have consequently been guessed at, or judged of from
the structure of the animal.' Such, evidently, is the
case with Mr. Sowerby, and several other writers who
treat on this subject.</p>

<p>Here we may call attention to the folly of naturalists
endeavouring to tag a pet theory upon all the
boring acephala, to the exclusion of every other.
Such a system is defended upon the principle that,
'it is much more philosophical to allow that animals,
so nearly allied as these in question, are more likely
to effect a similar purpose by the same means, than
that several should be adopted. Surely this is more
consistent with the unity of the laws of nature, and
that beautiful simplicity which is everywhere prevalent
in her works.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>How much more shrewd and philosophical are the
opinions of such a man as Professor Owen, who,
when speaking of the mechanical action of the valves
of <i>P. crispata</i>, says, 'To deny this use of the Pholas
shell, because the shell of some other rock-boring
bivalves is smooth, is another sign of a narrow mind.'
Again, this learned author forcibly remarks, in direct
opposition to the writer previously quoted, '<i>The
diversity of the organization of the boring molluscs
plainly speaks against any one single and uniform,
boring agent at all</i>!'</p>

<p>The more I study this subject, the more does the
truth of the last-mentioned statement become apparent
to my mind.</p>

<p>An examination of engravings of the shells, or
even of the Pholas itself, when lying loose in the
tank, or quietly seated in the rock, extending and
retracting its siphons, fails to give one the slightest
idea of its extraordinary appearance when enlarging
its dwelling. At such times it seems to be a totally
different animal, and to have suddenly acquired a
most marvellous degree of power, energy, and perseverance,
forming a striking contrast to its usual
quiet, passive habits.</p>

<p>In the first place, as I have elsewhere written, it
retracts its tube to, and even under, the level of its
shell, just as a man, about to urge onwards some
heavy mass with his shoulders, would depress his
head to increase and concentrate his muscular power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Then follows an expansion of the neck or upper part
of the ventral border, from whence the siphons protrude.
This movement closes the posterior portions
of the valves below the hinge, and brings their
serrated points together. The next act on the part
of the animal is to place its foot firmly at the base
of the hole; when leaning forward, it makes a
sweeping movement fully half round the cavity,
pressing firmly-upon the umboes, which nature has
strengthened for the purpose by two curved teeth
fixed on the inside of the valves. At this stage it
again reclines on its breast, and tilting up the shell
as much as possible, it makes another motion round
to its former position, leaning upon its back. By
these intricate movements, which the Pholas appears
to accomplish by a contraction almost painfully
strong, it opens the rasping points of the valves.
These execute a very peculiar scooping movement at
the base of the cavity, and the animal having got so
far, prepares itself for further exertion by a short
rest.</p>

<p>The specimen whose movements I have attempted
to describe, lived in my possession for a considerable
time. It bored so completely through the piece of
rock in which it was embedded, that the whole of
its foot dropped through the aperture, and remained
in this position for months, the animal, in consequence,
being unable to change its position even in
the slightest degree. Each movement of this specimen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
both before and while the hole at the base of
the cavity was gradually being enlarged, was
watched, and every striking and interesting feature
that occurred noted down at the moment. Various
queries were put and answered, as far as possible, by
direct ocular demonstration of the labours of the
animal in the vase before me.</p>

<p>I consider myself to have been singularly fortunate
in being able to view the actions of the creature from
beneath, in consequence of the hole being bored through
the rock. This circumstance allowed me distinctly to
see what was going on at the base of the orifice.</p>

<p>My early observations have fortunately been confirmed
in other captive Pholades, which at various
periods have been domesticated in my tanks.</p>

<p>I am convinced, then, that the shell forms the
<i>principal</i> agent in boring the animal's dwelling,
without either acid or flinty particles. The late
lamented Professor Forbes held that if this were the
case, the rasping points on the surface of the valves
would soon be worn down,&mdash;an appearance which,
he says, is never seen. With all respect for such
an eminent name, I must state that he was in error.
Not only are the edges at certain times worn, but
the rough surface is worn nearly smooth, appearing
in certain parts of a white colour, instead of a light
drab, as usual.</p>

<p>But the reader may ask, if certain parts of the
valves are occasionally worn smooth, and the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
works so vigorously, how is it that they are never
rasped through? This is a very natural question,
and one that I put to myself repeatedly.</p>

<p>I have made frequent and careful observations
while the animal was actually at work, in order to
satisfy myself upon this point, and have always
perceived that the particles of softened rock fell from,
and on each side of, the large and well-developed
<i>ligament</i> that binds the hinge, and extends to the
lowest points of the valves. Moreover, this leathery
substance always seemed scraped on the surface. I
cannot, therefore, but believe that the ligament aids
very materially in rubbing off the rock, or at all
events, in graduating the pressure of the valves
during the process, and that this curious organ,
instead of being worn away, may, like the callosity
upon a workman's hand, increase in toughness the
more labour it is called upon to perform.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The reason why so few specimens of the Pholades
exhibit a worn shell may be thus explained: As the
animal only bores the rock in sufficient degree to
admit of its increased bulk of body, it only requires
to bore occasionally, and there may be often an interval
of many months, during which time nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
may have renewed the serrated edge and rough surface
of the valves, and thus enabled the creature to
renew its wondrous operations.</p>

<p>We now come to a consideration of the foot,
which, as many writers aver, forms the 'sole terebrating
agent.'</p>

<p>Although this sweeping statement is incorrect, I
will freely admit that the foot constitutes an agent
second only in importance to the shell of the animal.
A casual examination of any Pholas perforation will
show that the foot could not have been the only
instrument by which the cavity was formed, from
the peculiar rings that line the lower portion of its
interior. These rough appearances, I feel convinced,
could be formed by no other means than the
rotatory motion of the shelly valves.</p>

<p>The valves, however, could not rotate and press
against the surface of the rock, were it not for the
aid which the foot affords to the animal, by its being
placed firmly at the base of the hole, and thus made
to act as a powerful fulcrum.</p>

<p>This supposition fully accounts for the lowest
extremity of the rocky chamber being always
smooth, and hollowed out into a cup-like form by
the action of the fleshy foot above alluded to.</p>

<p>The foot for a long time was a complete puzzle
to me: I was unable to satisfy my mind as to
how it acquired its seeming extraordinary power.
The phenomenon was fully explained when I became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
aware of the presence of that mysterious organ the
hyaline stylet, situated <i>in the centre of the foot</i>.
The use of this springy muscle, which is, as we have
shown in the previous chapter, by naturalists erroneously
considered to be the gizzard of the animal, is,
I believe, <i>solely to assist the Pholas in its boring
operations</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of my readers would like to know
how to procure a sight of the stylet; if so, their
wishes may be easily gratified. Take up a disentombed
Pholas in your hand, and with a sharp lancet
or point of a pen-knife, briskly cut a slit in the
extreme end of the foot, and, if the operation be
done skilfully, the object of your search will spring
out of the incision to the extent, it may be, of a
quarter of an inch. If not, a very slight examination
will discover the opal gelatinous cylinder,
which may be drawn out by means of a pair of
forceps.</p>

<p>When extracted and held between the finger and
thumb by its smaller end, the stylet will, if struck
with a certain degree of force, vibrate rapidly to and
fro for some seconds, in the same manner as a piece
of steel or whalebone would be affected, under like
circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>So long as a Pholas exhibits only the ends of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
siphons to the eyes of a greedy crab, it is perfectly
safe from attack. It is only when the fleshy foot
is unprotected that it falls a prey to some hungry
crustacean.</p>

<p>The toughness of the siphonal orifices is, I believe,
a most important point, for, as I shall endeavour to
explain, the siphonal tubes constitute important
accessory excavating agents, to those already enumerated.</p>

<p>We all know that the hole which each young
Pholas makes, when first he takes possession of his
rocky home, is extremely minute,&mdash;not larger than
a small pin's head; now, it stands to reason, that if
the shell was the only terebrating agent, the opening
of the cavity in question would always remain
of the same size, or, perhaps, on account of the
action of the water, a slight degree larger than its
original dimensions. Such, however, is not the
case.</p>

<p>Here is a fragment of rock exhibiting several
Pholas holes. The aperture of one of these, which I
measure, is nearly half-an-inch in diameter, while in
juxtaposition with it is situated another cavity,
measuring across the entrance less than the eighth
part of an inch. The reader will at once perceive,
if the foot and shell were the sole augurs, that as
the animal descended deeper into the rock, the
siphonal tube, as it enlarged in proportion to other
parts of the animal, would have to be drawn out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
an extremely fine point to fit the opening of the
tunnel. But as this is not the state of matters, the
conclusion forces itself upon us, that that portion of
the orifice situated above the shell of the animal
must be enlarged by the constant extension and retraction
of the siphons, aided by currents of water
acting on the interior surface of the cavity.</p>

<p>This same theory will also serve to explain how
it is that all Pholades situated at the same depth in
the rock, are not all of a uniform size. I have frequently
seen a piece of rock exhibit the peculiarity
of two burrows of vastly different proportions as
regards breadth, being precisely the same depth from
the surface of the stone. This appears to me
equally wonderful and puzzling at first sight, as the
'boring' question.</p>

<p>What age is attained by any species of the rock-borers
before they arrive at full growth, there are
no means of knowing. This point, like several
others in the history of these animals, still remains a
mystery, nor is it likely soon to be cleared up. The
largest specimen of <i>P. crispata</i> that I have seen is
at present in my possession. Each valve measures
three and a half inches in length, by two inches in
breadth. Some foreign specimens of this species,
and especially of <i>P. dactylus</i>, are, however, frequently
found of much larger dimensions.</p>

<p>On no occasion have I ever examined any Pholas
excavation that had lost its conical shape, a fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
seems to prove that the successive stages of the boring
operation must have taken place solely in consequence
of the animal not having reached its adult form.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
For had the shell attained its full development, and
its owner continued to labour, and rasp away the
rock, the sides of the cavity at its base would necessarily
present a parallel appearance&mdash;a phenomenon
which is never witnessed.</p>

<p>From this we may conclude that the depth of the
perforation, which is seldom many inches, depends
entirely upon the growth of the mollusc.</p>

<p>When keeping specimens of the Pholas for observation,
the usual plan is to chip away the rock to
the level of the valves, so that the whole of the
animal's siphonal tubes may be distinctly seen, however
slightly these organs may be extended. This
plan, I found, did very well for a time, but I was
annoyed to witness, that in the course of a few months,
the siphons ceased to be either advanced or retracted,&mdash;they
having become, as it were, rudimentary.</p>

<p>To obviate such contingency, the writer adopted
the following scheme.</p>

<p>To place in the tank a Pholas completely embedded
in a fragment of rock, so that nothing but the tips
of its siphons, when extended to the utmost, were
visible, would not afford much pleasure to the student.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
I therefore managed to saw away the rock
in such a manner, as to leave a narrow slit along
the entire length of the tunnel, so as to expose the
slightest movement of the animal within. Having
natural support for its siphons, I expected that these
organs would be constantly retracted and extended;
but such was not the case; at least for so long a
period as I had anticipated.</p>

<p>After repeated experiments, I have now discovered
that whether the siphons be protected as above
described or not, they will always be vigorously
exercised if the animal be placed in shallow water,
so that its tubes when fully extended will reach the
surface of the fluid.</p>

<p>The conclusion, from what has been stated, is, that
the Pholas can no longer be considered a weak and
helpless animal. Possessed of a rasp-like shell, a
horny ligament, retractile tubes, a strong muscular
foot, and a powerful spring or stylet, it is not by
any means difficult to conceive that these agents
when they are all brought into play, are fully equal
to the task of excavating the rocky chamber in
which the animal lives.</p>

<h2>XVII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Beauteous</span> stars also the sea contains, as numberless,
though not so brilliant in appearance as those
which stud the firmament of heaven; flowers, too,
grow beneath the wave, and rival in loveliness the
gems which adorn our fields and hedge-rows. Nay,
more, like the land, the ocean owns its various
grasses, its lemons, and cucumbers, its worms, slugs,
and shelly snails, its hedgehogs, its birds, its ducks
and geese (<i>anatidæ</i>), its dogs, its hares, and lastly its
<i>mice</i> (<i>aphroditæ</i>.) The latter objects, despite their
unprepossessing name, being in no wise less interesting
than those above mentioned.</p>

<p>The <i>Aphrodite aculeata</i> is, perhaps, one of the
most gorgeous creatures that inhabits the seas of our
British coast. Its body is covered with a coating of
short brown hairs, but as these approach the sides of
the animal, they become intermixed with long dark
bristles, the whole of which are of an iridescent
character. In one respect this creature bears no resemblance
to its namesake of the land, being extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
slow and sluggish in its movements (at least according
to our experience) when kept in confinement.
Some writers, however, affirm that the Aphrodite
possesses the power, although seldom exercised, of
both running and swimming through the water with
considerable speed.</p>

<p>In general the animal loves to tenant the slimy
mud, and wherever the writer has happened to come
upon a specimen at the sea-shore, its back has
always been thickly coated with sand or dirt. The
Sea-Mouse, then, unlike the peacock, can never be
deemed an emblem of haughty pride, yet has nature
in her lavish beauty endowed this humble inhabitant
of the deep with a richness of plumage, so to speak,
fully equal in its metallic brilliancy to that which
decorates the tail of the strutting bird we have
mentioned. As the bristles of the Aphrodite are
moved about, tints&mdash;green, yellow, and orange, blue,
purple, and scarlet&mdash;all the hues of Iris play upon
them with the changing light, and shine with a
metallic effulgence. Even if the animal, when
dead, is placed in clear water, the same varied
effect is seen as often as the observer changes his
position.</p>

<p>Not only are the <i>Setæ</i> worthy of notice on account
of their lustrous beauty, but also for their shape,
and the important part they play in the economy of
the animal. These lance-like spines seem to be used
by the Aphrodite as weapons of defence, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
spines of the hedgehog or porcupine. In some
species they are like harpoons, each being supplied
with a double series of strong barbs.</p>

<p>The instruments can all be withdrawn into the
body of the animal at will, but we can easily conceive
that such formidable weapons being retracted into
its flesh would not add to the creature's comfort&mdash;in
fact they would produce a deadly effect, were it
not for the following simple and beautiful contrivance.</p>

<p>Each spine is furnished with a double sheath
composed of two blades, between which it is lodged;
these sheaths closing upon the sharp points of the
spear when the latter is drawn inwards, effectually
guard the surrounding flesh from injury.</p>

<p>The shape of this animal is oval, the back convex,
while the under part presents a flat and curious
ribbed-like appearance. Its length varies from
three to five inches; specimens, however, are sometimes
to be procured, even on our own shores, of
much larger dimensions.</p>

<h2>XVIII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are not a few persons still to be met with, who
believe that man and the lower animals appeared
simultaneously upon the face of the earth. Geology
most forcibly proves the error of such an idea, for
although the fossilized remains of every other class
of organized beings have been discovered, human
bones have nowhere been found. This fact, though
deeply interesting, is perhaps not more so than many
others which this wonderful science has unfolded.
What can be more startling to the student for
instance, than the information that for a long period,
it may be thousands of years, no species of fish
whatever inhabited the primeval seas? True it is
that certain creatures occupied the shallows and
depths of ocean, but these were of the lowest type.
The most conspicuous were the coral polypes, which
even then as now were ever industriously building
up lasting monuments of their existence, as the
Trilobites, a group of Crustacea, and the Crinoids,
or Lily-stars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The last-mentioned group of animals were analogous
to the present tribe of Star-fishes, and are now
nearly extinct. The body of the Lily-star, which
resembled some beautiful radiate flower, was affixed
to a long, slender stalk, composed of a series of
solid plates superposed upon one another, bound
together by a fleshy coat, and made to undulate to
and fro in any direction at the will of the animal.
The stalk was firmly attached to some foreign substance,
and consequently the Crinoid Star-fish, unlike
its modern representative, could not rove about in
search of prey, but only capture such objects as came
within reach of its widely expanded arms. 'Scarcely
a dozen kinds of these beautiful creatures,' observes
Professor Forbes, 'now live in the seas of our globe,
and individuals of these kinds are comparatively
rarely to be met with; formerly they were among
the most numerous of the ocean's inhabitants,&mdash;so
numerous that the remains of their skeletons constitute
great tracts of the dry land as it now appears.
For miles and miles we may walk over the stony
fragments of the Crinoidae, fragments which were
once built up in animated forms, encased in living
flesh, and obeying the will of creatures among the
loveliest of the inhabitants of the ocean. Even in
their present disjointed and petrified state, they
excite the admiration not only of the naturalist, but
of the common gazer; and the name of stone lily,
popularly applied to them, indicates a popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
appreciation of their beauty.' Each wheel-like joint
of the fossil Encrinite being generally perforated in
the centre, facility is thus afforded for stringing a
number of these objects together like beads, and in
this form the monks of old, according to tradition,
used the broken fragments of the lily-stars as rosaries.
Hence the common appellation of St Cuthbert's
Beads, to which Sir Walter Scott alludes,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">'On a rock by Lindisfarn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">St. Cuthbert sits, and toils to frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea-born beads that bear his name.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One solitary species of the Crinoid Star-fishes has of
late years been found to flourish in our own seas; it
is, however, affixed to a stalk (pedunculated) only in
the early periods of its existence.</p>

<p>When first discovered by Mr. Thompson in its
infant state, the <i>Pentacrinus Europæus</i> was believed
to be a distinct animal. It was taken attached to
the stems of zoophytes of different orders, and
measured about three-fourths of an inch in height.
In form it resembled a minute comatula mounted on
the stalk of a Pentacrinus. Subsequent research has
proved that the little stranger was merely the young
state of the feather star <i>Comatula rosacea</i>, and that
although for a certain period attached to a slender
waving stem, the Pentacrinus, when arrived at a
certain stage of development, feels fully able to
start life on its own accord, and hence takes opportunity
to break off its early ties, and become a free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
animal, dependent upon its own exertions for subsistence.</p>

<p>It is no uncommon thing, as a late writer forcibly
remarks, in the inferior classes of the animal kingdom,
to find animals permanently attached from the
period of their birth, and during all their existence.
Familiar examples of this occur in the oyster, and
various other bivalve shell-fish, as well as in numerous
compound zoophytes. We likewise meet with races
which are free and locomotive in their first stages,
and afterwards become permanently fixed; but an
animal growing for a period in the similitude of a
flower on a stem, and then dropping from its pedicle,
and becoming during the remainder of its life free
and peripatetic, is not only new, but without any
parellel in the whole range of the organized creation.</p>

<p>The Comatula, or as it is commonly called, the
Rosy Feather-star, is allowed to be without exception
the most lively of all the star-fishes. Its movements
in swimming are said to resemble exactly the alternating
strokes given by the medusa to the liquid
element, and have the same effect, causing the animal
to raise itself from the bottom, and to advance back
foremost even more rapidly than the medusa. It
has ten very slender rays with numbers of long
beards on the sides. The body, which is of a deep
rose colour, is small and surrounded with ten little
filiform rays. The extremities of these organs are
shaped like claws, by means of which the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
attaches itself to various kinds of sea-weed, and other
submarine objects.</p>

<p>The adult Comatula generally measures about five
inches across its fully expanded rays.</p>

<p>Before treating of what are termed the <i>true</i> Star-fishes,
we require to dwell briefly upon an intermediate
family named by Professor Forbes the
<i>Ophiuridæ</i>, 'from the long serpent or worm-like
arms, which are appended to their round, depressed,
urchin like bodies.... They hold the same relation
to the Crinoidea that the true Star-fishes hold to
the Sea-Urchins. They are spinigrade animals, and
have no true suckers by which to walk, their progression
being effected (and with great facility) by
means of five long flexible-jointed processes placed
at regular distances around their body, and furnished
with spines on the sides and membraneous tentacula.
These processes are very different from the arms of
the true Star-fishes, which are lobes of the animal's
body, whereas the arms of the Ophiuridæ are super-added
to the body, and there is no excavation in
them for any longation of the digestive organs.'<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The British Ophiuridæ are now classed under two
genera; of the Ophiuræ, or Sand-stars only two
species (<i>O. texturata</i> and <i>O. albida</i>) are found on
our shores; and the Ophicomæ, or Brittle-stars, of
which there are ten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>An extraordinary feature, characteristic of all the
above-mentioned animals, is the great tendency which
they have to mutilate themselves, and throw their
limbs about in fragments on the slightest provocation.
If a specimen be handled, a certain number of fragments
will assuredly be cast off. If the rays become
entangled in sea-weed, or even if the water in which
the animal resides happens to become impure, the
same disastrous result follows, until nothing but the
little circular disc remains. As a set off against
this weakness, both the Ophiuræ and the Brittle-stars
possess reproductive powers of a high order.
Hence it not unfrequently happens that if each and
all the rays of a specimen be rejected, the animal
will live on, and eventually, perhaps, become a complete
and perfect star-fish.</p>

<p>The best means of preserving an Ophiura is to let
the devoted animal remain for a time expanded in
sea-water, then with a small pair of forceps lift it
carefully up, and plump it into a bath of cold 'fresh'
water, letting it lie there for about an hour. The
animal speedily dies, as if poisoned, in the fresh
liquid, in a state of rigid expansion. Some writers
recommend that, at this stage, the specimen should
be dipped for a moment into boiling water, and then
dried in a current of air; but I have never been
able to detect any great benefit arising from the
adoption of the process.</p>

<p>When examining any of the Brittle-stars, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
always found it an excellent plan to raise them up
by aid of the forceps applied to the disc. By this
means a specimen may be moved about without any
fear of mutilation; whereas if the fingers be used as
forceps, an unhappy result will assuredly follow.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Illus1"><i>Ophiocoma rosula</i></a>, figured on Plate 9, will
serve to convey to the reader a general idea of this
class of animals. Its popular title is the Common
Brittle-star, indicative of the inherent fragility of the
species, as also of their prevalent appearance at the
sea-shore; but, though so exceedingly 'common,'
we must at the same time in justice add, that the <i>O.
rosula</i> exceeds in beauty many other species which
are rare, and consequently more highly prized by
the collector.</p>

<p>It is very abundant on all parts of the British
coast, and is often found in clusters upon the stems
of <i>L. digitata</i>, and as frequently upon the under
side of boulders. In dredging, the Brittle-star is
an unfailing prize. It is a marvellous sight when
the scrapings of the ocean bed are spread out upon
the dredging-board for examination, to see hundreds
of these singularly delicate creatures twisting and
twining about in all directions,&mdash;over each other's
bodies, through the weed, sand, shells, and mud, and
strewing fragments of their snake-like arms upon
every surrounding object.</p>

<p>At the mere mention of 'Star-fishes,' the most
uninitiated reader will at once realize in his mind's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
eye a tolerably correct notion of the form of these
curious productions of the marine animal kingdom,
even although he had never seen a living or dead
specimen.</p>

<p>The body of the animal is divided into rays, like
the pictured form of one of the heavenly stars, and
the fancied resemblance is most apparent in the
Asteridæ, or true Star-fishes, of which we are now
about to speak.</p>

<p>This wonderful race of animals, for their beauty
of colour, elegance of shape, and peculiarity of structure,
possess a great degree of interest, not only to
the naturalist, but also to the casual observer by the
sea-side.</p>

<p>There are fourteen British species of Asteriadæ,
which are arranged under four families, namely&mdash;the
Urasteriæ, the Solasteriæ, the Gonasteriæ, and
the Asteriæ. This group contains no less than eight
generic types, clearly distinguished from each other
by certain characters, 'derived from the outline of
the body, the number of rows of suckers in the
avenues, and the structure and arrangement of the
spines covering the surface and bordering the
avenues.'</p>

<p>There are four species of Star-fishes belonging to
the genus Uraster, the most common of which is the
<i>Uraster rubens</i>, or Common Cross-fish.</p>

<p>No person in the habit of visiting the sea-shore
can be unfamiliar with the likeness of this creature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
which is generally seen lying wedged in some rocky
crevice, or among the Fuci, there patiently waiting
the return of the tide.</p>

<p>At such a time, the Devil's-hand (as the Irish
people term it), does not appear by any means
attractive. If placed in water, however, its appearance
becomes wonderfully improved.</p>

<p>Here is a small specimen, just brought from the
sea-shore at Cockburnspath (a most romantic and
delightful locality, situated on the coast of Berwickshire).
It is neatly wrapped up in a mantle of sea-weed.
Freed of its verdant envelope, I deposit the
youthful Rubens upon his back&mdash;'willy-nilly'&mdash;in
a tumbler partly filled with clear sea-water, and
then proceed to watch its movements through a
magnifier.</p>

<p>At a glance we perceive that each of its five rays
is grooved on its lower surface, and filled with
minute perforations, through which is gradually protruded
a multitude of fleshy suckers, knobbed at
the end. It is by aid of these organs that the
animal grasps its food, and changes its position, as
we shall presently see. One of the rays is now
slowly lifted up and moved about in various directions,
while from its extreme point the suckers are
extended to the utmost limit. No sooner do they
touch the side of the vessel than they are firmly
fixed and contracted. A <i>point d'appui</i> being thus
gained, the animal is enabled by degrees to draw its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
body round, so as to get another regiment of suckers
into play, and, by such plan of operations being
repeated, the animal is eventually enabled to 'right
itself,' and crawl up the polished surface of the glass.</p>

<p>Generally, when the Star-fish is disturbed, or
placed on a dry piece of stone, the suckers are withdrawn
into the body, leaving no signs of their previous
existence except a series of minute tubercles.
In fact, the Asterias, although enabled to adhere
with great tenacity to any foreign object when immersed
in water, possesses but little power to retain
its hold if the fluid be removed. Hence the young
zoologist, keeping this peculiarity in mind, should
not too hurriedly return a verdict of 'Found dead,'
when he meets with a helpless specimen upon the
beach, for in all likelihood, were the creature to be
laid for a few minutes in a rock-pool, it would soon
exhibit signs of returning animation.</p>

<p>A simpler, though not so sure a test for ascertaining
whether a Star-fish be living or not, is to handle the
specimen. If it feels soft and flabby, it is dead; but
if tolerably firm to the touch, it may be 'recalled to
life,' by the means pointed out.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to chronicle here a
singular circumstance which the writer has often
verified in connection with the true Star-fishes. It
is this. When any captured specimens have been
placed in confinement, no matter how large or small
such might be, they never moved through the liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
element with a tithe of the rapidity that I well knew
they were capable of. At the sea-side, I have seen
a specimen of the Cross-fish glide through the water
so nimbly, yet withal so gracefully, that I have felt
inclined to rank natation among the few other acomplishments
of which the species can boast.</p>

<p>The <i>Uraster rubens</i> is also popularly known as
'Five Fingers.' For ages past it has been subject
to the bitter denunciation of fishermen and others,
for the injury which it is said to inflict upon
oysters. At one time, according to Bishop Spratt,
the Admiralty Court laid penalties upon those engaged
in the oyster-fishing who did not tread under
their feet, or throw upon the shore, a fish they call a
Five-Finger, resembling a spur-rowel, because that
fish gets into the oysters when they gape, and sucks
them out. Poets have also endeavoured to perpetuate
the vulgar opinion:&mdash;</p>

<p>Even yet the oyster fishermen at certain localities
wreak all possible vengeance upon the 'submarine
Dando's,' for their supposed gourmandizing propensities.
I say <i>supposed</i>, for although so many
naturalists have studied the question, it is not, up
to the present time, satisfactorily settled. Some
deny the alleged tendency altogether, while less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
sceptical observers are unable to understand the
mode in which the Star-fish could injure an animal
apparently so capable of self-defence as the oyster.
According to certain authors, the Star-fish encircles
the oyster with its five fingers, and by some clever
process of suction destroys the unfortunate mollusc.
Others, again, maintain that the first step of the
attack is the injection of some marine chloroform
between the shells of the oyster, and that during the
insensibility that follows, the Star-fish effects an
entrance.</p>

<p>As this is an interesting subject, perhaps the
reader would like to have the exact words which
are used by two celebrated naturalists, one of whom
attempts to vindicate the character of the Asteridæ,
the other to blacken it.</p>

<p>Sir John Dalyell&mdash;a high authority upon all
matters of marine zoology&mdash;shrewdly remarks: 'I
have not heard it suggested that the Star-fish possesses
any kind of solvent compelling the bivalves
to sunder. Neither can its hostility be very deadly
to the larger univalves, from the distance to which
they are enabled to retreat within their portable
dwellings. Their general habits are, to force the
shells of smaller bivalves asunder, and to devour the
contents; they likewise consume the substance of
ordinary fishes entire; nevertheless, as far as I am
yet aware, their destruction of oysters is destitute of
evidence. The Star-fish sometimes shows an eversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of stomach, or of some membrane of it. Whether
this may be the means of affecting their prey, merits
investigation.'</p>

<p>Professor Jones, who affirms that in the latter
suggestion Sir J. Dalyell has nearly hit upon the
true solution of the problem, thus gives what <i>he</i> considers
to be the correct mode of procedure on the
part of the Star-fish: 'Grasping its shell-clad prey
between its rays, and firmly fixing it by means of its
prehensile suckers, it proceeds deliberately to turn its
stomach inside out, embracing in its ample folds the
helpless bivalve, and perhaps at the same time instilling
some torpifying fluid, for the shells of the poor
victim seized soon open, and it then becomes an easy
prey.'</p>

<p>Now, many fishermen with whom I have conversed
hold the same opinion as Bishop Spratt, and
believe that when the oyster is gaping the Star-fish
insinuates a finger, and hastily scrapes out the delicious
mouthful; nay, further maintain that the
Star-fish is far from being successful at all times,
very often, especially when there has only been one
ray inserted, the frightened oyster grasps it with all
his might, and obliges his discomfited opponent to
retire minus a limb.</p>

<p>If the writer might venture to suggest an opinion,
he would express his belief that the following is the
correct account of the state of matters. He believes
with the fishermen that frequently the star-fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
begins his attack by inserting an arm, but he does
not believe that the oyster under such circumstances
escapes with life. Let us suppose the star-fish to
have succeeded in insidiously introducing a ray
within the shell of the apathetic oyster, and that the
oyster immediately resented such intrusion by closing
his shell with all the force he can exert. The opposite
argument at this stage is, that the intruder is
obliged from <i>pain</i> to abandon his hold, and even pay
for his audacity by the forfeit of a limb. But
against this we advance the notorious fact, that the
star-fish, like so many marine creatures of a similar
organization, is remarkably indifferent to pain. I
therefore believe the true explanation to be, that the
oyster being unable to sustain such continued muscular
exertion for nearly so long a time as the star-fish
can tolerate the pressure upon its ray, the latter
is consequently, in the long run, successful.</p>

<p>The number of rays in the several genera of the
true Star-fishes is extremely various. In the genus
<i>Uraster</i>, as we have seen, five is the predominant
number. If we turn to the two species which comprise
the genus <i>Cribella</i>, we still find the quintuple
arrangement adhered to. In <i>Solaster endeca</i>, on the
contrary, the rays vary from nine to eleven, and
even reach as high as twelve or fifteen in <i>Solaster
papposa</i>.</p>

<p>In the genus <i>Palmipes</i> we have the pentagonal
form, it is true, but the space between each ray is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
filled up, so as to resemble the webbed foot of a
bird, hence the popular title of this solitary species,
'The Bird's-foot Sea-star.' 'It is the flattest of all
its class, and when alive it is flexible like a piece of
leather.' Passing by the 'Cushion-stars' (which
have five <i>angles</i>&mdash;it seems a misnomer to call them
rays), which connect the true Star-fishes with the
Sea-Urchins, we come lastly to the 'Lingthorn,'
<i>Luidia fragillisima</i>, with its seven rays. This is
the animal of which Professor Forbes discourses so
pleasantly about its winking derisively at his despairing
endeavours to preserve even a small portion of
what at that time was his maiden specimen. The
Luidia is even more brittle&mdash;more regardless of its
wholeness, than the <i>Ophiuræ</i>, which renders the
capture of a perfect specimen a most difficult task.</p>

<h2>XIX.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sea-Urchins</span> are frequently taken in dredging.
Several common species, usually of a small size, are
often found among the rocks situated between tide
marks.</p>

<p>Into the aquarium no specimens larger than from
one to two inches in diameter should be introduced,
and even these require to be closely watched, for if
afflicted with a fatal illness, I know of no animal
whose remains sooner taint the water. Almost before
life is extinct, the Urchin throws out a light-coloured
nauseous fluid, that speedily poisons the surrounding
water, and, of course, causes the destruction
of any inhabitants of the tank who may neither
have the sense nor opportunity to inhale copious
draughts of fresh air. As a rule, if the suckers are
motionless, or if on touching the animal it is
found not to be adherent to any object, transfer it
at once to your 'infirmary' for further observation.</p>

<p>I have always found small specimens to be much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
more lively and walkative, (if I may be allowed the
expression) than their more corpulent brethren.</p>

<p>The inflexible, mail-like crust, or shell, as it is
commonly called, of the Echinus is perhaps one of
the most marvellous objects on which the eye can
rest. Although at first sight it appears to be a solid
calcareous box, it is in reality composed of several
hundred pentagonal plates,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> of various sizes, so closely
dove-tailed together that their marks of junction are
scarcely perceptible. Upon a superficial examination
we are apt (most erroneously) to consider this
wonderful piece of work to be more elaborate than
the wants of the animal demand. The fact of the
Lobster or Crab throwing off its entire shell at certain
seasons, to admit of the increased growth of the animal
is a truly marvellous phenomenon, still, it would more
excite our wonder were we to find that, instead of
being cast away at all, the hard, inelastic envelope
which surrounds the bodies of crustaceans was made
to swell or expand proportionately with the soft
parts of the animal! Now, the mosaic-like shell of
the Sea-Urchin, though built up, as before stated, of
several hundred pieces, is by a beautiful process
slowly and imperceptibly enlarged correspondingly
with the growth of the animal.</p>

<p>The gradual enlargement of the Echinus shell takes
place in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Over the entire surface of the globular shell,
spines, and joints of the living Urchin, there exists a
delicate membrane that insinuates itself between
the pentagonal plates above mentioned, and continually
deposits around the edges a certain portion
of calcareous matter (carbonate of lime). The same
process being also carried on by the fleshy covering
that surrounds the spines, &amp;c., it must be evident
that so long as the vital power of the animal exists,
each plate and spine, still keeping to its original
form, must be daily and hourly augmented in size
until the Sea-Egg has attained its full and mature
dimensions.</p>

<p>As to how the spines retain their relative position
in each plate, as the latter gradually becomes
enlarged, I cannot positively state; but may be
permitted to mention, that, judging from carefully
prepared sections of the plates when submitted to the
microscope, each spine appeared to my eye to be by
some singular process urged along in a kind of groove
to its proper place.</p>

<p>The hedgehog-like spines that surround the
globose body of the Sea-Urchin are all moveable
at the will of the animal,&mdash;each prickle being connected
by a ball-and-socket joint to a pearly tubercle,
which acts as the 'socket' on which the 'ball' of
the spine revolves. If the spine be removed, a
comparatively smooth surface will be left, on which
are various sized tubercles systematically arranged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Situated at regular intervals between the tubercles
are ten broad bands, disposed in pairs, and containing
many hundreds of very minute perforations, or
ambulacral orifices, as they are generally termed by
naturalists.</p>

<p>Through these apertures issue numerous sucker-like
feet, closely resembling those of the Star-fish,
but endowed with far greater powers of contraction
and extension.</p>

<p>The number of suckers is very great. In an
Urchin measuring exactly three inches in diameter,
by aid of a hand lens, I counted no less than 3300
pores in the ten avenues. Now, these pores are
always situated in pairs, and as each sucker occupies
a pair of pores, it will give 1650 as the total amount
of suckers.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that it is almost entirely by
means of these curious organs that the Sea-Urchin
is enabled to move about from place to place, although
no less an authority than Professor Agassiz
asserts to the contrary. 'How, in fact,' says this
author, 'could these small tentacula, situated as they
generally are in that part of the body which is never
brought into contact with the ground when the
animal moves, and overhung by calcareous solid
spines&mdash;how, I ask, could these flexible tubes be
used as organs of motion? It is an undeniable fact,
and I have often observed it myself, that <i>it is with
their spines the Echini move themselves, seize their</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
<i>prey, and bring it to their mouths</i> by turning the
rays of their lower edge in different directions. But
the correction of an error respecting the functions of
the ambulacral tubes does not solve the problem relating
to their nature and use. This problem we are
yet unable to solve, as we know nothing more respecting
them than that they are connected with the
aquiferous system.'</p>

<p>Many other writers, among whom is Professor
Forbes (from whose work on Star-fishes I have
transferred the foregoing extract), assert, in opposition
to the great Swiss naturalist, that the Echinidæ move
by the joint action of their suckers and spines. 'The
argument,' says the great British naturalist, 'against
the suckers being organs of motion, founded on their
position above as well as below, would equally apply
to the spines, to which organs Professor Agassiz
has attributed all progressive powers in these
animals.'</p>

<p>The fact is now so well established, that it is
scarcely necessary for the writer to state, that from
personal observation he can fully confirm the evidence
of Professor Forbes relative to the functions of the
suckers of the Sea-Urchins. But although that
talented author entertained no doubt as to the organs
in question being powerful locomotive agents, he
evidently seems to have felt himself unable to suggest
any purpose they could possibly serve when
situated on the back or upper part of the animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>My own experience incontestibly proves that the
suckers in question are used for precisely the same
purpose as those situated in any other part of the
body. I am enabled to state, from having repeatedly
witnessed the phenomenon, that <i>the Echinus can
walk about with equal facility while lying on its
back as in its more natural position</i>. The advantage
of this power to the animal under certain circumstances
will be apparent upon a little reflection.</p>

<p>With regard to the spines, I fancy their purpose
is almost solely to assist the Urchin to burrow in the
sand, and to protect it from the attacks of its enemies.
It may be, however, that at particular times they
serve as aids to locomotion, but that their assistance
can be, and is, often dispensed with entirely by the
animal, I can most positively assert.</p>

<p>My experiments were always conducted in glass
vases, up the smooth, polished sides of which my
specimens frequently advanced. Upon reaching the
surface of the water, I have seen an Urchin roll
completely round and move along on its back, then
after a time change its position, and travel round
the circumference of the vessel <i>while attached by its
side</i>, the body of the animal being sometimes inverted.</p>

<p>At such times as these it must be quite evident
that the spines would be totally useless, and that by
the suckers alone did the animal perform its interesting
movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>According to a certain writer, there are some
foreign species of the Echini remarkable for possessing
spines, which act both as offensive and defensive
weapons. 'On one occasion' (this writer says) 'when
searching for a fish in the crevice of a coral rock, I
felt a severe pain in my hand, and upon withdrawing
it, found my fingers covered with slender spines,
evidently those of the Echinus, of a grey colour,
elegantly banded with black.</p>

<p>'They projected from my fingers like well-planted
arrows from a target, and their points being barbed
could not be removed, but remained for some weeks
imbedded as black specks in the skin. Its concealed
situation did not permit me to examine this particular
Echinus. In some experiments I approached the
spines with so much caution, that had they been the
most finely pointed needles in a fixed state no injury
could have been received from them, yet their points
were always stuck into my hand rapidly and
severely.'</p>

<p>In addition to those above described, the Sea-Urchin
is provided with other organs, in shape somewhat
resembling minute pincers, supported on fleshy
stems, which always keep up an incessant motion
when the animal is in a healthy condition. They are
scattered in great numbers over the surface of the
body, among the spines, and around the mouth of
the Urchin.</p>

<p>The use of these singular objects&mdash;by naturalists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
termed Pedicellariæ&mdash;is totally unknown. Some
writers think they are an integral part of the Echinus,
others describe them as distinct and parasitic animals.
There is good reason to believe that the former will
eventually be proved to be the correct explanation
of the matter.</p>

<p>Its masticatory apparatus is not the least wonderful
portion of the Sea-Urchin. The teeth, five in
number, which may frequently be seen protruding
from the mouth, are of extreme hardness, and of
seemingly disproportionate length. They are not
fixed in sockets as ours are, or they would be speedily
worn away by their action on the shelled mollusca
upon which the animal feeds, but fresh substance
is added to each tooth as fast as it is worn away
by use, as in the case of many gnawing animals.
'In order to allow of such an arrangement, as well
as to provide for the movements of the teeth,
jaws are provided, which are situated in the interior
of the shell, and these jaws, from their great
complexity and unique structure, form perhaps the
most admirable masticating instrument met with in
the animal kingdom. The entire apparatus removed
from the shell consists of the following parts. There
are five long teeth, each of which is enclosed in a
triangular bony piece, that for the sake of brevity
we will call jaws. The five jaws are united together
by various muscles, so as to form a pentagonal
pyramid, having its apex in contact with the oval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
orifice of the shell, while its base is connected with
several bony levers by means of numerous muscles
provided for the movements of the whole. When
the five jaws are fixed together in their natural position,
they form a five-sided conical mass, aptly
enough compared by Aristotle to a lantern, and not
unfrequently described by modern writers under the
name of "the lantern of Aristotle." The whole of
this complicated machinery is suspended by muscles
from a frame-work fixed in the interior of the shell,
and may often be picked up upon the beach, or
still better exposed <i>in situ</i> in a dead Echinus, by
those who would examine closely this wonderful
piece of mechanism.'<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>I have made two careful drawings of the jaws
and teeth of the Echinus. No. 1 represents, as it
were, the 'elevation' of the pentagonal pyramid
above described, while No. 2 constitutes the 'plan'
of the same object.</p>

<p>The <i>Echinus sphæra</i>, or common Egg-Urchin,
may often be seen forming a curious ornament
in the drawing-rooms of the "West End," and
also in the dwellings of the poorer classes, who,
according to some authors, boil it like eggs, and
so eat it. Hence its popular title. Among the
ancients the Echinidæ were accounted a favourite
dish. 'They were dressed with vinegar, honied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
wine or mead, parsley and mint. They were the first
dish in the famous supper of Lentulus when he was
made Flamen Martialis. By some of the concomitant
dishes they seemed designed as a whet for the second
course to the holy personages, priests and vestals,
invited on the occasion.'</p>

<p><a href="#Illus10">The illustration on Plate 10</a> was drawn from a
living specimen, and gives a somewhat unusual representation
of a Sea-Urchin. In general the spines
alone are shown, but I have endeavoured to give the
uninitiated reader some faint notion of the appearance
which the <i>suckers</i> present when extended from the
surface of the shell.</p>

<p>The young Urchin sat very quietly while I was
engaged in taking his portrait, but continually extended
crowds of his slender tubular legs in all
directions, as above indicated, much to my gratification
and apparently to his own.</p>

<p>In preparing a Sea-Urchin for a chimney ornament,
the most important point is to remove the spines so
as to let the tubercles remain entire. In performing
this operation some little experience is necessary.
Several times I attempted the process by aid of a
pen-knife and a pair of pliers, but not with a satisfactory
result. Having mentioned my difficulty to
a friend, he laughingly asked me if I had ever heard
of a certain pilgrim who, for some peccadillo he had
committed, was doomed to perform penance by
walking to Loretto's shrine with peas in his shoes?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Of course I was acquainted with the story, but could
not see what it had to do with Sea-Urchins, and
told my brother naturalist so. Still smiling, he said,
'Do you remember the relief that was said to be
afforded to the humorous rascal, both mentally
and bodily, by <i>boiling his peas</i>?' Yes. 'Well,
then,' was the reply, 'do you boil your Sea-Eggs,
and you will find your troubles speedily cease.' I
did as I was directed, and found the advice of great
service; for, after being an hour or two in the 'pot,'
the spines of the Urchin may be totally rubbed off
by aid of a nail brush, or some such instrument.
Moreover, the colour of the shell is improved, and the
dental apparatus may be drawn out entire, with the
greatest ease.</p>

<p>I may here take opportunity to mention, that the
student who may think proper to act upon the hint
above given, should not boil the Urchin too long, or
the fleshy parts will become dissolved, and the entire
shell fall into a multitude of fragments.</p>

<p>This unfortunate result actually happened on one
occasion to a genial, clever friend of mine, much to
his chagrin and my malicious delight.</p>

<p>There are several other species of Sea-Urchins
whose forms are tolerably well distinguished by their
popular appellations. Thus we have the 'Silky
Spined Urchin;' the 'Green Pea-Urchin,'&mdash;the latter
is the commonest and prettiest of all its kindred, its
back being covered with a kind of powdery green, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
is seen on the elytra of many beetles; the 'Cake-Urchin,'
which from its flattened form may be regarded
as a link between the Sea-Urchins and the true
Star-fishes; the 'Purple Heart-Urchin,' and the
pretty 'Rosy Heart-Urchin,' appropriately named
from the brilliant crimson hue that its body presents
during life.</p>

<h2>XX.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a very singular group of animals, the
<i>Holothuriadæ</i>, that claims a passing notice, from
their near relation in structural formation to the
Sea-Urchins, although externally they also exhibit
a certain resemblance to the <i>Annelides</i>. They are
commonly termed Sea-Cucumbers, from the fancied
likeness which they bear, both in shape and colour,
to their namesakes of the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>A Holothuria is very unattractive in appearance
when lying listless upon the sea-beach, but if a small
specimen be transferred to the aquarium, it exhibits
features of a very singular and interesting character.
When about to change its position, the head, hitherto
concealed, is protruded and expanded, until it assumes
the form of a beautiful flower.</p>

<p>The animal moves principally by aid of sucker-like
feet, similar in form to those of the Asteriadæ,
or Sea-Urchins. In most species, the body is divided
longitudinally into five rows of suckers. In some,
however, these organs are scattered over the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
surface, while in the small Sea-Cucumber (<i>Psolus
phantapus</i>), they are arranged in three rows
upon a soft, oblong, flat disc, situated beneath the
body of the animal, like the foot of a gasteropod
mollusc.</p>

<p>Of one genus&mdash;the Trepang&mdash;many species are
eaten by the omnivorous inhabitants of the Celestial
Empire, by whom it is employed in the preparation
of 'nutritious soups, in common with an esculent
sea-weed, shark's fins, edible birds' nests, and other
materials affording much jelly.' The intestines,
which are generally found to be filled with coral,
and solid masses of madreporic rock, are extracted,
and the animal then boiled in sea-water and dried
in smoke.</p>

<p>Nothing can possibly be less enticing than the
black and shrivelled carcases of these defunct gasteropods,
as they are seen spread out and exposed
for sale in the China markets. There are many
varieties of Trepang, some being held in higher
esteem than others,&mdash;hence the great difference
which exists in the price of the article. The lowest
quality being ten dollars, and the highest fifty dollars,
per pecul of 133 lbs.</p>

<p>The following are titles by which a few of the
Holothuriæ are known in China:&mdash;</p>

<p><a href="#Illus11">The illustration on Plate 11</a> gives a good idea of
the typical form of the Holothuriadæ. It represents
a species of the genus Cucumaria, <i>C. communis</i>,
or common Sea-Cucumber. Its length is
from four to eight inches; but, like all its kindred,
it possesses the power of considerably extending or
contracting its body at will. The Tentacula are ten
in number, pinnate and plumose, stalked and rather
large. The body is five-sided, with numerous suckers
on the angles, but more on the sides, which are
papilose. The colour is yellow, or brownish-white,
although specimens found on the Irish coast exhibit
a purplish hue.</p>

<p>This, the most common species of its genus, is an
inhabitant of deep water, and is therefore most frequently
taken with the dredge. Occasionally, specimens
may be found after violent storms stranded on
various parts of the shores of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Sea-Cucumbers possess the singular power of
disembowelling themselves upon the slightest provocation,
and also of throwing off their Tentacula
entire. There is one species, indeed, that exhibits a
still more wonderful phenomenon. At certain times
members of this species will divide their body into
a number of parts, each of which will in due course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
become a new and completely-formed animal. After
this the reader will be prepared to learn, that to build
up a new inside, or create a new set of branchiæ, is
to a Holothuria a very trifling and insignificant
task.</p>

<h2>XXI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> several parts of the Scottish coast, and especially
at North Berwick, may be found specimens of that
curious gasteropod named the Aplysia, or Sea-Hare,
the <i>Lepus marinus</i> of the ancients.</p>

<p>On visiting North Berwick during summer, I have
been astonished to discover, in almost every pool,
from two to twenty of these creatures.</p>

<p>At rest, the Aplysia is not by any means inviting,
but when in motion, elevating and depressing the
fleshy mantle that covers over the fringed and lobed
branchiæ, its appearance is exceedingly graceful.</p>

<p>Striding across a pool on the look-out for some
Gobies, whose forms darting beneath a large stone
had not escaped my glance, I perceived the water in
the rocky basin gradually lose its crystal brightness,
and become changed to crimson. The Gobies were
therefore allowed to rest in peace, while I proceeded
to investigate a phenomenon that, at the moment,
seemed somewhat singular.</p>

<p>A kind friend and brother zoologist, who happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
to be near, called attention to the fact that the
crimson stream flowed thickest near where my foot
rested.</p>

<p>On closely examining the spot pointed out, and
turning over some fronds of Dulse, we came upon a
small fleshy ball of a dark brown colour, from which
there still issued a fluid of vivid crimson hue.
Having placed this strange object in a bottle, I soon
pronounced it to be an Aplysia, with whose full-length
portrait, as represented in books, I had previously
been made acquainted.</p>

<p>The power which this animal possesses, under irritation,
of spurting out a peculiar secretion, I also remembered
to have seen mentioned by several writers
on natural history.</p>

<p>Although generally believed to be gentle and perfectly
harmless, yet, as Professor Forbes observes,
few molluscs have had a worse character than the
Aplysiæ. From very ancient times they have been
regarded with horror and suspicion; and many
writers on natural history, conversant with them
only through the silly stories of ignorant fishermen,
have combined to hold them up as objects of detestation.
To touch them, according to European prejudices,
was sufficient to generate disease in the foolhardy
experimenter; while Asiatics, reversing the
consequences, maintained, perhaps with greater truth,
that they met with instantaneous death when
handled by man. Physicians wrote treatises on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
effects of their poison, and discussed the remedies
best adapted to neutralize it. Conspirators brewed
nauseous beverages from their slimy bodies, and
administered the potion confident of its deadly
powers. Every nation in the world on whose shores
the poor Sea-Hares crawled, accorded to them the
attributes of ferocity and malignant virulence, although
there never appears to have been the slightest
foundation for a belief in their crimes.</p>

<p>A specimen of the Aplysia that I had in my tank
deposited a stringy coil of spawn, which closely resembled
that of the Eolis, with the exception that
the eggs, instead of being white, were of a reddish
tint.</p>

<h2>XXII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the exception of the Balani (Acorn-Barnacles),
perhaps the most common objects to be met with at
the sea-shore are the Serpulæ. Scarcely a rock, or
shell, or bit of old china, or piece of wood, or rusty
nail, lying near low-water mark, but is encrusted
with colonies of these animals. I have a small twig
of a tree by me, so thickly coated with Serpulæ as
to obscure all signs of its ligneous character, except
at each end. A shell also exhibits the same phenomenon,
and well-nigh defies the most skilful observer
to define its original form with any degree of certainty.</p>

<p>The shelly tubes of these animals are built in the
form of serpents, or twisted funnels, of a milk-white
colour. Although so extremely hard, these tubes
are formed solely by an exudation from the body of
the animal&mdash;a simple marine worm. Unlike its
erratic friend, the earth-worm, the Serpula is sedentary
in its habits, and at no time does it ever leave
its dwelling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>The delicate, but brilliant feathery plume&mdash;the
only portion of the animal ever visible&mdash;constitutes
the principal mechanism by means of which the Serpula
constructs its calcareous tube.</p>

<p>A most wonderful instance of how mighty are the
works which these insignificant creatures form when
congregated together in vast numbers, and how
useful such labours may sometimes be to mankind,
is narrated by Dr. Darwin in his 'Voyage of the
Beagle.'</p>

<p>Being delayed by adverse winds, this gentleman
made a stay at Pernambuco, a large city on the coast
of Brazil, and the most curious object that he saw
there was the reef that formed the harbour. 'I
doubt,' to use his own words, 'whether in the whole
world any other natural structure has so artificial an
appearance. It runs for a length of several miles
in an absolutely straight line, and parallel to, and
not far distant from the shore. It varies in width
from thirty to sixty yards, and its surface is level and
smooth; it is composed of obscurely stratified hard
sandstone. At high water the waves break over it;
at low water its summit is left dry, and it might
then be mistaken for a breakwater erected by Cyclopean
workmen. On this coast the currents of the
sea tend to throw up in front of the land long spits
and bars of loose sand, and on one of these the town
of Pernambuco stands. In former times a long spit
of this nature seems to have become consolidated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the percolation of calcareous matter, and afterwards
to have been gradually upheaved, the outer and loose
parts during the process having been worn away by
the action of the sea, and the solid nucleus left as we
now see it. Although night and day the waves of
the open Atlantic, turbid with sediment, are driven
against the steep outside edges of this wall of stone,
yet the oldest pilots know of no tradition of any
change in its appearance. This durability is by far the
most curious fact in its history; <i>it is due to a tough
layer, a few inches thick, of calcareous matter, wholly
formed by the successive growth and death of the
small shells of Serpulæ, together with some few Barnacles</i>,
&amp;c. These insignificant organic beings, especially
the Serpulæ, have done good service to the
people of Pernambuco, for without their protective
aid the bar of sandstone would inevitably have been
long ago worn away, and without the bar there would
have been no harbour,'</p>

<p>Nothing whatever appears to be known relative to
the mode of reproduction of these Annelids. I have
paid much attention to the subject, but as yet have
not gained any positive information regarding it.
The only fact which I consider worthy of being
chronicled is the following: On one occasion, when
quite a novice in Marine Zoology, while observing a
beautiful group of Serpulæ seated on a stone, I saw
issuing from out one of the tubes a kind of very fine
dust, of a rich crimson hue, which continued to arise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
for nearly an hour in spite of repeated efforts to disperse
it by aid of a camel-hair pencil. At first I
believed the 'dust' to be the 'remains' of a deceased
serpula, but afterwards found that such was not the
case, the annelid being alive and healthy. Never
having seen the phenomenon since, it has been a
great source of regret to me that I did not endeavour
to discover what the dust was composed of; but
have little doubt that the microscope would have
shown it to be, in reality, the ova of the Serpula.</p>

<p>Another class of Annelidans, termed Sabellæ, like
the Serpulæ, also build habitations for themselves,
but not of the same materials. Instead of being
white, the tubes of the first mentioned animals are
brown in colour, and composed of minute granules of
sand, or small shells, and lined internally with a
gelatinous substance exuded from the body of the
worm. On the interior of the oyster and other
shells, and even in univalves occupied by the Lobster
Crab, various tubes of Sabellæ may often be seen.
They are, however, generally discovered congregated
together, forming a kind of honeycomb mass in the
fissures of rocks, or against the sides of rock-pools, or
on the surface of small stones, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A mass of Sabellæ tubes forms by no means an
inappropriate or unpleasant object for the tank, as
the animals are hardy, and will live for many months
if the water be kept pure. Moreover, while in confinement,
they do not live in luxurious indolence, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
ever seem to be busy in the exercise of their architectural
propensities, making alterations, repairing
damages, or otherwise 'sorting' their tubiculous
habitations.</p>

<p>'The tubes of the Sabellæ,' says Dr. Williams,
'are soft, flexible, and muddy. Slimy mucus furnished
by the integumentary glands of the body is
the mortar or cement, fine sand molecules are the
"stones" or solid material of the architecture. In the
Sabellæ the lime of which the tubes are built is held
in solution in the mucus provided by the cutaneous
glands. It is adjusted in the fluid form, and
moulded by appropriate tools into the required shape.
It then <i>solidifies, too, under water</i>, like the "Aberthaw
lime." The tube of the Sabellæ fits closely
round the body of the worm; it is slightly elastic,
and the interior is smooth.'</p>

<h2>XXIII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Few</span> people who are in the habit of visiting the sea-shore
but must have noticed the empty shells of
the animal about to be described. I allude to the
Solen, or Razor-Shell, commonly so called from its
resemblance to the handle attached to a barber's
scythe.</p>

<p>This bivalve, improbable as the statement will
appear to the uninitiated, is one of the most efficient
burrowers to be met with on our shores.</p>

<p>By means of its fleshy foot it digs a hole in
the mud or sand. Sometimes it retreats from
the surface to a distance of several feet, but
generally remains sufficiently near to allow its
short, fringed siphons to project above the
sand.</p>

<p>In walking along the beach, left bare by the receding
tide, the pedestrian may often perceive little
jets of water thrown up at his approach. These jets
proceed from the Razor-Fish in question. Although
we may be several yards from his burrow, his sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
of feeling is so acute, that the faintest vibration of
the earth around causes the creature to retire alarmed
within his dwelling.</p>

<p>In many places the Solen is much sought after by
the poor, who esteem it a great luxury. In foreign
countries&mdash;Japan, for example&mdash;it is so highly
prized that we are told, 'by express order of the
prince of that country, it is forbid to fish them until
a sufficient quantity hath been provided for the
emperor's table.'</p>

<p>The Irish people, when they go out to catch the
Solen siliqua, have an appropriate song and chorus
which they sing, but whether to amuse themselves or
charm the fish 'this deponent sayeth not,' for very
obvious reasons. In general, I should think the less
noise the more likelihood of success to those endeavouring
to capture this animal.</p>

<p>'Who has not seen the picture of the stupid-looking
boy going warily out with a box of salt, having
been gravely informed by some village wag that if
he would only just drop a pinch of salt on the birds'
tails he would be sure to catch them. We are all
familiar enough with this venerable joke, but not so
with its successful application in another case. This
time it is the fisherman, instead of the village boy,
who carries the box. He cautiously slips a little salt
into the hole, which irritates the ends of the siphons,
and makes the <i>Solen</i> come quickly out to see what
is the matter, and clear itself of this painful intrusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
The fisher, on the alert, must quickly seize his
prey, or else it will dart back again into its retreat,
whence no amount of salting or coaxing will bring it
out again.'</p>

<p>If after reading the above quotation any person
should fancy that in his mind's eye he perceives at
many sea-side places, scores of hardy, weather-beaten
fishermen walking about, each armed with nothing
but a box filled with salt, wherewith to bamboozle
the Spout-Fish, he will be most lamentably deceived.
True it is, this plan is sometimes adopted by children
and amateur naturalists, but by fishermen&mdash;never.
Instead of a salt-box, these, when in search
of their favourite bait, always carry a kind of harpoon,
formed of a piece of iron rod, the end of which
is sharpened to a point.</p>

<p>Having witnessed the Solen throw up his jet of
water, and retire beneath the soil, the fisherman
suddenly plunges his instrument into the orifice.
Should the action have been skilfully performed, the
rod will have pierced the animal between its valves,
which instantly retract upon the intruding object.
To draw the fish to the surface is then a comparatively
easy task. If the first plunge of the rod be not
successful, the fisher knows full well it would
be futile for him to repeat the attempt, as the
object of his attack would quickly burrow itself
down to such a depth as to render pursuit hopeless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Juveniles at the sea-side, imitating the plan above
described, become by practice very expert in procuring
specimens of the Razor-Fish by means of a piece
of wire sharpened at one end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the best <i>bons mots</i> that I ever remember to
have read was entitled, 'Punch's Address to the
Ocean'&mdash;</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
'With all thy faults I love thee <i>still</i>.'</p>

<p>Any landsman who finds himself occupying a seat in
a fishing-smack or oyster-boat while a stiffish breeze
is blowing will, I am sure, with great mental fervour
echo the above sentiment.</p>

<p>For myself, I can never take even a short trip
on the water without experiencing some unpleasantness&mdash;proving
to me that the sea is not 'my element.'
Still, I am one of those to whom the 'salt
ocean' is endeared by early recollections, having
been, when a child, frequently among the aged and
mutilated veterans of our country who vegetate on
the banks of the 'silver Thames.'</p>

<p>From the tobacco-stained mouths of some of these
old blue-jackets (all of whom, I may mention, according
to their own account, had fought 'alongside of
the <i>galyant</i> Nelson'), many strange stories have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
poured into my eager and willing ears, and even
now a thrill of delight is evoked when any of these
'yarns' rise to remembrance. Still, the truth must
be told: ever since I narrowly escaped drowning
by plumping into the water backwards, from leaning
against the <i>unsnibbed</i>-door of a bathing-machine,
and at another time from being in a boat that, to
my intense horror and dismay, had sprung a leak&mdash;I
have enjoyed the sea best when my feet are on dry
land; in other words, I like to view the 'world of
fluid matter,' in its various phases, from a distant
and perfectly safe point of view. Nay more, I can
always better appreciate certain of its beauties (at
all events during winter time) when seated by a
warm fireside.</p>

<p>When lately in such a cosy position, my thoughts
reverted to the marvellous operations ever going on
within the liquid walls of the great deep. There
artifices and stratagems, robbery and murder, and
cannibalism in its worst forms continually occur.
On the other hand, there may be scenes of courtship,
touching instances of maternal affection, such
as, were they chronicled, would make our hearts
bleed with truest sympathy. Still, the Rob Roy
maxim of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'They should take who have the power,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And they should keep who can,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>seems therein to be carried out with a rigour that
would do honour to the 'bold outlaw Macgregor.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Might there is generally predominant over right.
Fishes eternally prey upon each other; and for such
reason, were it not for the wonderful fecundity of
these creatures (one cod-fish, for instance, producing
several millions of ova in a single season), we should
soon have the waters depopulated of all but the
monsters of the deep.</p>

<p>Now, knowing that such a state of things exists&mdash;that
cannibalism is of such frequent occurrence,
and the dogs of war are there ever let loose&mdash;the
inquiry naturally presented itself: Are the inhabitants
of the ocean a happy race or not? According
to many writers, the answer must be given in
the affirmative; nay, more, some authors state, and
with good show of authority, too, be it observed,
that <i>fishes are in reality the happiest of created
things</i>, by reason that they have no fear or apprehension
of death, nor are they subject to pain or
disease, nor, in fact, to any of those ills that <i>flesh</i> is
heir to. These creatures cannot, of course, live for
ever; but by a merciful dispensation of Providence,
their final pang endures but for an instant.</p>

<p>The celebrated St. Anthony is among the believers
in the consummate happiness of the finny tribe.
There is on record a discourse said to have been
preached by him to an assembly of fish, in which
they are flattered to an amazing extent. It almost
rouses one's jealous ire to find such fulsome adulation
bestowed upon the lower animals, at the expense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
of all other objects in nature, not excepting
<i>man</i> himself. There is, however, such a singular force
and truthfulness in some of the expressions and
sentiments which occur in the Jesuitical discourse
alluded to (given by Addison in his 'Remarks on
Italy'), that I cannot resist the temptation of quoting
a few of its most prominent passages.</p>

<p>We are told that St. Anthony, feeling annoyed
at certain heretics not listening devoutly to his
preaching, he determined to teach them a lesson;
and for this purpose went down to the sea-shore, and
called the fishes together in the name of God, that
they might hear his holy word. The fish soon swam
towards the speaker in vast shoals, and, having
ranged themselves, according to their several species,
into a very beautiful congregation, were addressed
just as if they had been rational creatures.</p>

<p>The sermon commences in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>'My dearly-beloved Fish,&mdash;Although the infinite
power and goodness of God discovers itself in all
the works of his creation, as in the heavens, in the sun,
in the moon, and in the stars&mdash;in the lower world, in
man, and in other perfect creatures,&mdash;nevertheless, the
goodness of the divine Majesty shines out in you more
eminently, and appears after a more particular manner,
than in any other created beings.</p>

<p>'It is from God, my beloved fish, that you have
received being, life, motion, and sense. It is he
that has given you, in compliance with your natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
inclinations, the whole world of waters for your
habitation. It is he that has furnished it with
lodgings, chambers, caverns, grottoes, <i>and such magnificent
retirements as are not to be met with in the
seats of kings or in the palaces of princes</i>!</p>

<p>'You have the water for your dwelling&mdash;a clear,
transparent element, brighter than crystal; you can
see from its deepest bottom everything that passes
on its surface. You have the eyes of a lynx or of
an Argus; you are guided by a secret and unerring
principle, delighting in everything that may be beneficial
to you, and avoiding everything that may be
hurtful; you are carried on by a hidden instinct to
preserve yourselves, and to propagate your species;
you obey, in all your actions, works, and motions, the
dictates and suggestions of nature, without the least
repugnance or contradiction.</p>

<p>'The cold of winter and the heat of summer
are alike incapable of molesting you. A serene
or a clouded sky are indifferent to you. Let
the earth abound in fruits or be cursed with
scarcity, it has no influence on your welfare. You
live secure in rains and thunders, lightnings and
earthquakes; you have no concern in the blossoms
of spring or in the glowings of summer, in the fruits
of autumn or in the frosts of winter. You are not
solicitous about hours or days, months or years,
the variableness of the weather or the change of
seasons.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>The saint still further 'butters his fish' by reminding
them, among other things, that they were
specially favoured by God at the time of the universal
deluge, they being the only species of creatures
that were insensible of the mischief that had
laid waste the whole world! He then begs of them,
as they are not provided with words, to make some
sign of reverence; give some show of gratitude,
according to the best of their capacities; express
their thanks in the most becoming manner that
they are able, and be not unmindful of all the
benefits which the divine Majesty has bestowed
upon them.</p>

<p>He had no sooner done speaking, but behold a
miracle! The fish, as though they had been endued
with reason, bowed down their heads with all the
marks of a profound devotion, and then went
joyously bobbing around with a kind of fondness, as
in approval of what had been spoken by the blessed
father, St. Anthony.</p>

<p>Many of the heretics, as a matter of course, were
converted at beholding the miracle; and the polite
and pious little fishes, having received his benediction,
were dismissed by the saint.</p>

<p>Shakspeare authoritatively asserts that&mdash;</p>

<p>Here I beg to differ with the sweet Bard of Avon,
who, I am sure, would have retracted his statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
had he read the above fishy discourse, and also the
following among many other strange anecdotes
which are published regarding the 'denizens of the
deep.'</p>

<p>An Eastern traveller tells us that, 'in a certain river
whose waters flow from Mount Caucasus into the
Euxine, there arrives every year a great quantity of
fish.' This information not being particularly novel
in regard to most rivers, will fail to excite surprise
in the mind of the reader. A different result, however,
will follow when he hears that, according to
Abon-el-Cassim, 'The people cut off all the flesh on
one side of those inhabitants of the deep, and let
them go. Well, the year following,' as this veracious
writer avers, 'the same creatures return and offer
the other side, which they had preserved untouched;
it is then discovered that new flesh has replaced the
old!'</p>

<p>This account reminds us of the tale of the traveller
who reported that he had seen a cabbage, under
whose leaves a whole regiment of soldiers were sheltered
from a shower of rain. Another, who was no
traveller (but the wiser man), said he had passed by
a place where there were four hundred braziers making
a cauldron&mdash;two hundred within, and two hundred
without beating the nails in. The traveller,
asking for what use that huge cauldron was, he
told him, 'Sir, it was to boil your cabbage!' A
wittily severe, but deserved rebuke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many other statements regarding fishes
which, although curious, are, nevertheless, to a certain
extent true.</p>

<p>The Chinese, for instance, who breed large quantities
of the well-known gold-fish, call them, it is
said, with a whistle to receive their food. Sir
Joseph Banks used to collect his fish by sounding a
small gong; and Carew, the historian of Cornwall,
brought his grey Mullet together to be fed by making
a noise with two sticks.</p>

<p>In spite of these accounts, there are many writers
who affirm that <i>fishes do not possess the sense of
hearing at all</i>; and certainly a belief that these creatures
are gifted with such a faculty is not necessary,
in my opinion, in order to explain the above-mentioned
phenomenon.</p>

<p>At the fountains, in the gardens of Versailles, the
writer has seen numbers of fishes flocking together
and anxiously waiting for the subscriptions of the
visitors. Now, had a bell been rung, these animals,
doubtless, would have appeared at the edge of the
fountain as usual; but had the bell <i>not</i> been sounded,
and any human figure been visible, they would have
taken up the self-same position.</p>

<p>I have, at various times, kept packs of fishes
(Blennies, &amp;c.), and tamed them, so that each member
would feed out of my hand. For some time I
used to attract them to the side of the vessel in
which, they resided by striking a wine glass with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
small stick; but I also noted that if I made myself
visible, and remained silent, while handing down a
few fish mouthfuls, that the whole pack followed as
readily as if I had sounded the mimic gong. Nay,
whether I offered any bribe or not, and silently approached
their crystal abode, the whole family would
immediately flock in great haste towards me.</p>

<p>The tameness of these little creatures was somewhat
remarkable. On numberless occasions I have
taken them up in the palm of my hand, without the
slightest opposition on their part, and then stroked
and smoothed them on the back, as I would do a
bird. At such times they made a kind of musical
chirp, expressive of pleasurable emotion, and seemed
in no hurry to escape into their native element even
when I laid my hand in the water.</p>

<p>Such delightful confidence was always rewarded
with some dainty.</p>

<p>Dr. Warwick relates an instance of instinct and
intelligence in the Pike, which is so remarkable
that I am sure my readers will be pleased to be made
acquainted with it. I am the more induced to transfer
it to these pages, from the remarks with which
the doctor closes his narrative. From reasons
stated above, the reader will be prepared to learn
that I do not consider the statements therein advanced&mdash;that
fishes are really sensible to sound&mdash;by
any means conclusive.</p>

<p>When residing at Dunham, the seat of the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Stamford and Warrington, he (Dr. Warwick), was
walking one evening in the park, and came to a
pond where fish intended for the table were temporarily
kept. He took particular notice of a fine
pike of about six pounds weight, which, when it
observed him, darted hastily away. In so doing
it struck its head against a tenterhook in a post (of
which there were several in the pond, placed to prevent
poaching), and, as it afterwards appeared, fractured
its skull, and turned the optic nerve on one
side. The agony evinced by the animal appeared
most horrible. It rushed to the bottom, and boring
its head into the mud, whirled itself round with such
velocity that it was almost lost to sight for a short
interval. It then plunged about the pond, and at
length threw itself completely out of the water on
to the bank. He (the doctor) went and examined
it, and found that a very small portion of the brain
was protruding from the fracture in the skull. He
then carefully replaced this, and with a small silver
toothpick raised the indented portion of the skull.
The fish remained still for a short time, and he then
put it again in the pond. It appeared at first a good
deal relieved, but in a few minutes it again darted
and plunged about until it threw itself out of the
water a second time. A second time Dr. Warwick
did what he could to relieve it, and again put it in
the water. It continued for several times to throw
itself out of the pond, and with the assistance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
keeper, the doctor at length made a kind of pillow
for the fish, which was then left in the pond to its
fate. Upon making his appearance at the pond on
the following morning, the pike came towards him
to the edge of the water, and actually laid its head
upon his foot. The doctor thought this most extraordinary,
but he examined the fish's skull and found
it going on all right. He then walked backwards
and forwards, along the edge of the pond for some
time, and the fish continued to swim up and down,
turning whenever he turned; but being blind on the
wounded side of its skull, it always appeared agitated
when it had that side toward the bank, as it
could not then see its benefactor. On the next day
he took some young friends down to see the fish,
which came to him as usual, and at length he actually
taught the pike to come to him at his whistle, and
feed out of his hands. With other persons it continued
as shy as fish usually are. He (Dr. Warwick)
thought this a most remarkable instance of
gratitude in a fish for a benefit received, and as it
always came at his whistle, <i>it proved also what he
had previously, with other naturalists, disbelieved,
that fishes are sensible to sound</i>. (?)</p>

<p>On hunting among the rock-pools by the sea-shore,
several peculiar little fishes are frequently to
be found, and although some of them cannot be considered
suitable for the aquarium, still, for the reader's
information, it may be as well that I devote a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
brief space to a description of the peculiarities of
each.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting of all the finny occupants
of the rock-pool, is, to my taste, the Smooth
Blenny, or, as it is variously termed, Shanny, or
Tansy. It is also more abundant than many other
species, and may therefore be readily captured during
summer. The Blenny varies from two to five
inches in length. The back is ornamented with
exquisite markings, but the most characteristic
features are the peculiar bluntness of the head, and
the brilliant crimson dot both on and immediately
beneath the eyes.</p>

<p>Although easily tamed, the Blenny, in his native
haunts, appears to be the most timid of animals,
darting with the rapidity of lightning to the shelter
of some stone or overhanging weeds at the remotest
indication of approaching footsteps, or the
faintest shadow of a human form being cast on the
water.</p>

<p>When desirous to procure a specimen, it is best to
choose as small a pool as you can for your hunt.
Drop in your net at one end, and as the Shanny
precipitately retreats to the other, give him chase.
Having arrived at the extremity of his domain, he
will endeavour to hide among the weeds, but if you
hold your net across the pool with one hand, and
with the other lift up a stone or beat the bushes,
the little fellow will become greatly excited, and darting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
out, of course, unwillingly, falls into the snare
prepared for him.</p>

<p>Having gained your prize, do not handle it, but
placing your finger under the net, tilt it over the
mouth of the bottle, and allow the Blenny to fall
as gently as possible into the water. You need
be under no uneasiness after introducing him to the
aquarium about the nature of his diet. He is far
from being epicurean in his tastes. I supply mine according
to my whim at the moment, with whatever
is at hand, a bit of fowl, roast beef, or the like.</p>

<p>The only caution I adopt when giving animal
food to the Blenny is to remove all traces of fat. I
mince their food into minute particles, and having sufficiently
moistened it, I place a morsel upon a hair
pencil. This attention to their comforts the Blennies
soon learn to appreciate, and will, after a while,
display at meal times the sagacity of larger animals.</p>

<p>Perhaps the simplest plan to adopt is to cut open
a mussel and throw it into the tank. A considerable
deal of amusement, moreover, is often to be obtained
by watching the fishes engaged at such a meal.
How they toss the valves of the Mytilus about, and
snap at each other's tails! How vexed they become
if by accident the shelly dish is turned topsy-turvy,
and resists all their man&oelig;uvres to reverse it so as to
get at the meat! The valves of a large mussel will
sometimes be literally cleaned out by some half dozen
Blennies in the course of an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>I have noticed a singular fact in connection with
the Blenny&mdash;namely, <i>that they do not all increase in
size as they grow older</i>. Out of five that I kept
domesticated for more than two years, one specimen
remained at the end of that period of the same size
as when I first made its acquaintance in a rock-pool
by the sea-shore, while its companions had greatly
increased their proportions. But let me in justice
add, that if my little finny pet failed to increase in
corpulency, it gained largely in intelligence. Who
is there that has not seen children, short in stature,
and comparatively old in years, who deserve the
epithet applied to them by the vulgar, of 'little&mdash;but
<i>knowing</i>.' This remark would apply with great
truth to my 'little Dombey' fish.</p>

<p>Before becoming expert in carrying out the plan
(which will be fully detailed hereafter) for clarifying
the water of an aquarium which has become opaque
from superabundant vegetative growth, I had to
submit to many annoying failures. Thus it was in
a certain instance.</p>

<p>I had cleaned out my tank, refilled it with partially
purified water, and again inserted the various
animals constituting my 'stock.' Emboldened by the
success which had attended my operations, I thought
a still further dose of diluted acid might be added, in
order thoroughly to remove the greenish hue of the
water. A few minutes showed me the folly of not
letting well alone, for soon flakes of discharged vegetation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
were precipitated to the base of the vessel, covering
it with a coating of fur.</p>

<p>The poor Blennies speedily showed signs of distress,
and changed colour, as they generally do, upon the
most trifling cause. Instead of dark brown or black,
their bodies appeared of a yellowish tint, spotted
with white. Such a change was lovely to the eye,
but, alas! it was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">'The loveliness in death,<br /></span>
<span class="i18">Which parts not quite with parting breath.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The little creatures jumped and dived about in all directions,
all their motions being extremely violent. I
quickly perceived the error which had been committed,
and, moreover, discovered to my chagrin that
such error could not possibly be rectified for some
time, on account of my not having by me any
reserve of pure salt water. Taking several of the
fishes in my hand, I stroked their backs with a
camel-hair pencil, and was pleased to find that as
their alarm subsided their natural hue returned.
My being obliged to place my pets in their unhappy
and pestilential home again was, as the reader may
suppose, a source of regret to me; but I had some
hopes that they might by chance survive, and
become used to the 'vapour of their dungeon,' at
all events until such time as I could hasten to
the sea-side and procure a new supply of water.
My expectations of such a result were built upon
the fact, that although four of the fishes had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
changed colour, the small Blenny still retained its
natural hue. How did this happen? it will be
asked. I answer, by little Dombey (doing as his
brethren had always hitherto done in similar circumstances)
leaping on to a ledge of rock that projected
out of the water, and there breathing the fresh air
in safety.</p>

<p>On the following morning I peeped into the vessel,
and saw by their upturned gills that all my finny
proteges were dead!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">'All my pretty ones?<br /></span>
<span class="i20">Did I say all?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All except the smallest of the pack, he was still
dressed in his sombre coat, and gracefully reclining
upon the rocky couch above mentioned.</p>

<p>How thankfully he received the breakfast that I
temptingly offered upon the tips of my feeding brush,
and how grateful he seemed to be, when, after the
lapse of a few hours, I was enabled to let him float
again in his pure native element, a fresh supply of
which had been procured with as little delay as
possible!</p>

<p>The Viviparous Blenny differs from the other
British Blennies 'in the circumstance to which its
name refers&mdash;that of bringing forth its young alive,
which seem perfectly able to provide for themselves
from the moment they are excluded.'</p>

<p>It is a most gentle, graceful-looking fish, but as
far as my experience goes, one that is impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
tame, or rather, I should say, embolden. All my
efforts to domesticate various specimens have proved
unavailing; and in spite of the most earnest and
kindly attention, they have generally pined away and
died within a week after their introduction to the
aquarium.</p>

<p><a href="#Illus12">From the illustration on Plate 12</a> the reader will
have no difficulty in recognising the original, should
he by chance meet with it hiding among the tangle,
or beneath the stones by the sea-shore.</p>

<p>The spotted Blenny, Butter-Fish, or Gunnel-Fish,
as it is variously termed, is found lurking under stones
in the same places as the preceding. In the north
of Scotland it is called 'cloachs,' and is used extensively
as a bait for larger fish. When disturbed, it
wriggles its body about in the muddy bottom of the
rock-pool like an eel, for which, indeed, it is occasionally
mistaken.</p>

<p>Its length varies from three to nine inches; the
depth only half an inch; the sides very much compressed
and extremely thin.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin consists of seventy-eight short spiny
rays, and runs the length of the back almost to the
tail. The most conspicuous feature in the Gunnel-Fish
are the eleven round spots which occur at the
top of the back, and reach the lower half of the dorsal
fin; they are black, half encircled by white.</p>

<p>The tail is rounded, and of a yellow colour. The back
and sides are of a deep olive; the belly whitish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>In its young state I have had this fish live in my
aquarium for several months, but it never seemed to
be happy or contented.</p>

<p>The Five Bearded Rockling is almost as great a
favourite with the writer as the Smooth Blenny. It
is a very pretty fish, and may be easily tamed. In
the course of a week I trained one to feed out of
my hand, and when I put my finger in the water the
fish would rub against it with its head, just as a
favourite cat frequently does against the leg of a
person with whom it is very familiar; moreover, if I
moved the intruding digit with a circular motion
through the water, the Rockling would waltz round
the tip with evident signs of pleasure.</p>

<p>This fish is often found in tide-pools, and may
readily be identified by the prominent appendages
attached to its head, to the presence of which, the
Rockling owes its familiar appellation.</p>

<p>The Goby (<i>Gobius unipunctatus</i>), or, as it is more
popularly termed, One-Spotted Goby, is frequently
found inhabiting the same pool as the Blenny or the
Rockling. The distinguishing character of this
pretty creature is the black spot which is situated
between the fifth and sixth ray of the first dorsal fin.
Its length is usually about one, or one and a half
inches; specimens have, however, sometimes been
found on the shores of the Frith of Forth, that measured
nearly three inches.</p>

<p>The colour of the Goby is very changeable. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
animal is labouring under excitement, its body
assumes a deep brownish tint, approaching in some
instances to black; this gives place to brown, drab,
and even amber, or yellowish white.</p>

<p>The Goby possesses the power of attaching its body
to any object by means of its ventral fins, which become
united together in the form of a funnel.</p>

<p>Another species (<i>Gobius bipunctatus</i>), or Two-Spotted
Goby, is generally found among the <i>Fuci</i>, in
rocky situations. Its name is derived from a dark
spot which is distinctly apparent on each side, near
to the origin of the pectoral fin.</p>

<p>The head and upper part of the body is dark brown,&mdash;the
under part of the head and belly white or pale
drab.</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the peculiarity
of the Gobies affixing their bodies to rocks or other
substances, by means of a sucker formed by the
junction of the ventral fins. The adhesive power in
question, which this class of creatures possess, is very
limited as compared with that which is exercised by
the true sucker fishes, and especially by the members
of a certain species, whose bodies are furnished
with two distinct organs of adhesion.</p>

<p>The extraordinary adhesive powers of the Lump-Sucker,
for instance, have been tested by several
writers. One observer states, that a fish of moderate
size has been known to suspend a weight of
above 20 lbs., upon which it had accidentally fastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
itself. Mr. Pennant says still more, for he has known
that, in flinging a fish of this kind just caught into
a pail of water, it fixed itself so firmly to the bottom,
that, on taking it by the tail, the pail was lifted up,
though it contained several gallons of water.</p>

<p>To descend from the largest to the smallest species,
we arrive at the Montague Sucker-Fish, or, as it is
sometimes called, the Diminutive Sucker, one of the
most interesting little creatures to be met with at
the sea-shore. At the coast near Edinburgh I
have met with many specimens, equally well in
the spring or winter season, as during the summer
months. At such locality this species may
therefore be pronounced common; yet it is comparatively
unknown to most 'collectors' in the neighbourhood.
Many, indeed, contend that my designation
is erroneous. But having taken considerable
pains to satisfy my mind upon the subject, I have no
hesitation whatever in stating that the little fish in
question is identical with that of the Montague Sucker.</p>

<p>Donovan, in his 'Natural History of British
Fishes,'<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> was the first to illustrate and publish an
account of this <i>petite</i> gem of ocean. His figures are
copied from drawings made by Colonel Montague,
who also furnished the description of the specimen
delineated.  With the important exception of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
sucker&mdash;an organ of adhesion which is very nearly
correct&mdash;the general appearance of the Diminutive
Sucker-Fish as figured, is not at all satisfactory.
Perhaps this is not to be wondered at, when we
remember that the specimen from which the sketches
were taken was very small indeed. Moreover, it
was diaphanous, and is depicted as being principally
transparent, spotted, and tinged with pink.</p>

<p>The Diminutive Sucker, in its adult state, is said
to be from two to three inches in length; consequently
Colonel Montague's first specimen must have
been an extremely young one.</p>

<p>The usual colour is deep orange, varied with
minute dark spots. The under parts of the body
and throat are of flesh colour; the centre of the
sucker being faintly tinged with crimson.</p>

<p>I have seldom met with specimens measuring
more than one, or one and a quarter inches. It
is a marked peculiarity in this Sucker-Fish, that
when adhering to any substance it has a constant
habit of curving the tail towards the head. In
such position it will remain motionless for several
hours.</p>

<p>There is little difficulty in capturing the Montague
Sucker in its native haunts. It does not
possess the power of darting to and fro with the
speed of the Blenny, or most other fishes, but progresses
through the liquid element with a peculiar
quivering motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not a fish that can be recommended for the
aquarium. A fortnight to three weeks is the longest
time that I have been able to keep a specimen
alive; indeed, until I adopted the plan of allowing
each little captive to remain quiet and undisturbed
in a dark and shady place, death ensued in the course
of one or two days.</p>

<p><a href="#Illus12">My illustrations (Plate 12)</a> having been carefully
drawn and coloured from a living specimen, the
student will, I trust, find no difficulty in recognising
the Diminutive Sucker, should he be so fortunate as
to meet with it in a rocky pool.</p>

<p>'There is also a fish called the Sticklebag, a fish
without scales, but hath his body fenced with several
prickles. I know not where he dwells in winter,
nor what he is good for in summer, but only to
make sport for boys and <i>women anglers</i>.' Thus
contemptuously does dear old Izaak speak of the
Sticklebag, or Stickleback, as it is now termed, one
of the most amusing and interesting members of the
finny tribe. I have frequently transferred specimens
of the Stickleback from fresh water to salt water,
and found them live quite as well in the latter as in
the former.</p>

<p>The contrast, however, between the appearance of
the three spined Stickleback, when first taken from
the sea, and one captured in the fresh water pond is
very remarkable. The first is dressed in a gorgeous
coat of varied colours. Around the mouth and belly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
it is bright crimson, on the upper part of its body
various tints of green prevail; while in the pond
specimen no red colour is visible at all, but only
white blended with green.</p>

<p>In addition to <i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>, whom we
have above alluded to, there is another species, <i>G.
spinachia</i>, or Fifteen-Spined Stickleback, which is
also an inhabitant of rock-pools by the sea-shore,
but unlike the first-mentioned, is never found in fresh
water. Both species possess one peculiarity in common,
a description of which will form an appropriate
conclusion to this chapter. I allude to their nest-building
habits, which has only of late years been
proved to exist, although Aristotle has recorded the
same fact regarding a fish (<i>Phycis</i>) in the Mediterranean
Sea, which was known to make a nest and
deposit its spawn therein.</p>

<p>The duties of mason and architect are invariably
undertaken by the male Stickleback. His materials
are of course very limited, still his labours are skilfully
and even artistically performed. Having chosen
a suitable spot as a foundation for his house, he collects
some delicate sea-weeds, gravel and sand, and with
these materials, aided by a glutinous fluid which is
given off from his body, the house is built. When
completed, and not before, he seeks out his mate, and
invites her to take possession of her newly formed
home. If she shows any affectation or coquetishness,
he does not hesitate to nip hold of her tail, and urge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
her forward by equally expressive signs. Soon, like
a dutiful little pet, she enters, and having deposited
spawn, retires again, leaving her lord and master to
guard the casket and its living treasure. This task,
though extremely arduous, he adopts with pride and
gratification.</p>

<p>How so small a creature can bear up so long under
such a state of apparent excitement appears marvellous.
His assiduity is most extraordinary. By night
he rests beside the nest, and by day, if he can
possibly hinder it, he allows nothing to approach.
When there are other members of the Stickleback
family in the aquarium, numerous combats are sure
to ensue, for as the young and transparent offspring
of one fish are deemed a great dainty by the non-parental
body, the latter invariably endeavour to
satisfy their cannibal propensities at the harrowing
expense of their neighbours.</p>

<p>When the spawn are hatched, fresh care devolves
upon the parent, in order to keep them within the
nursery, and protect them from the greedy mouths of
the larger fish, always on the look-out for tit-bits.
Should one of the little fishlings stray beyond the
prescribed bounds, the watchful parent darts after it,
and in an instant his jaws close over the wanderer
apparently for ever, but in fact only for a time, for
swimming quickly back the old fish puffs out the
straggler into its nest lively and uninjured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> ornament for the drawing-room or parlour can
possibly be more beautiful than a well-stocked and
tastefully-arranged aquarium; nor is there one likely
to be productive of a greater amount of pleasure and
amusement. And it is instructive as well as amusing,
for by means of it the statements of writers relative
to the habits of certain marine animals may be verified
by personal observation, and even difficult problems
in natural history satisfactorily solved. Aided
by one of these 'mimic oceans,' let the reader commence
the practical study of marine zoology, and I
have little fear of his ever becoming tired of it.</p>

<p>When pursued even in the most humble way, this
recreation yields a degree of interest greater than
any other 'hobby' can produce, at least in an equal
space of time. If engaged in business during the
day, the student can always devote an hour morning
or evening to the aquarium, and when least expected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
some circumstance will take place to excite his
wonder, and fill his mind with deep and devout reflection.
Moreover, the young naturalist will undoubtedly
derive pleasure from his endeavours to establish
published facts relative to many of his little prisoners;
pleasure in noting down any interesting anecdote
that may occur; pleasure in knowing that his time
is being profitably spent; and above all, that he
is making himself acquainted with objects framed
with marvellous skill and care by the hand of the
Almighty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Wonderful indeed are all His works,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Without further preface, I shall now proceed to
offer some practical hints relative to the establishment
of a marine aquarium. And, as some of my
readers may be perfectly unacquainted with the
subject, I shall treat it in as simple a style as
possible. If, however, the experienced zoologist
will kindly follow me to the end of the chapter, it
may be that he will find some hints sufficiently
new and useful to repay him for his trouble.</p>

<p>First, then, in regard to the tank. This indispensable
requisite may be procured at certain shops
in almost every town in the United Kingdom. Its
price varies from two or three shillings to £20.
The expensive kinds are generally oblong in form,
but their construction being somewhat intricate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
they are apt to get out of order, unless made by skilful
and thoroughly competent artistes. Under
certain circumstances, there is no doubt that an
oblong tank of moderate dimensions is a great
desideratum; but what I wish particularly to
impress upon the mind of the reader is, that a large
tank is not at all necessary in order to study the
habits of marine animals; indeed, the more capacious
the vessel, the more difficult becomes the task
of watching the secret movements of any of its occupants.
On this account it not unfrequently happens
that a common glass tumbler becomes of much
greater service to the student than the most elaborate
aquarium.</p>

<p>The tanks which I use are circular in form, the
largest being not more than sixteen inches in
diameter, by seven inches in depth. Its cost was
four shillings. Each one rests on a base of mahogany,
elevated on turned legs to a height of nine inches.</p>

<p>Some persons object to the circular tank, on the
ground that its occupants when seen from the sides
appear magnified. This fact, as I have elsewhere
remarked, is rather a recommendation with me, as
it presents more distinct views of each movement
in the vessel, and whenever I wish to see the objects
of their natural size, I can do so by looking in from
the top.</p>

<p>On the edge of the tank are placed three chips
of gutta percha in which are inserted three steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
pins with brass heads; on these there is laid a
circular piece of common glass, cut two inches larger
than the diameter of the tank. As the 'pins' are
about three-quarters of an inch above the tank, they
allow a current of air to pass over the water, and
also prevent, to a certain extent, particles of dust
from falling in. On the edge of the movable lid
I <i>paste</i> some crimson lace, which serves for ornament,
and also prevents the glass from cutting the
hand of any person moving it about. Sometimes
I have a circular piece, about four inches in diameter,
cut out of the centre of the glass lid, which allows
the latter to be lifted off easily.</p>

<p>A glass syringe to aerate the water occasionally,
a camel-hair pencil, an ivory crotchet pin, and a
pair of gutta percha forceps, complete the whole
machinery of the aquarium, the cost of which is so
trifling that the poorest person might manage to
procure them.</p>

<p>One great point in favour of an aquarium, and
one by no means generally understood is, that having
once filled the tank with salt water, it will last
for months, and even years, if proper care be taken,
without requiring one particle of sea-water to be again
added; for as the water evaporates, the salt falls to
the bottom, and the deficiency may be supplied with
<i>fresh</i> water from the cistern or filter. In order to
ascertain when the sea-water is of the proper density,
you require to have a 'gravity bubble,' which can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
had for sixpence. This may always be kept in the
tank. When 'all's well' it sinks to the bottom,
and when anything comes amiss it rises to the surface,
but falls again quickly upon the introduction of
the fresh water.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>A more simple plan is, to mark on the glass the
height of the fluid when the tank is first filled, then
as the water sinks, raise it again to its original level
by means of fresh water.</p>

<p>Many persons decline starting an aquarium on
account of the great difficulty of procuring a proper
supply of sea-water. This objection, of course, can
be offered only by those who happen to reside
inland; but even these need not now be discouraged,
for an ingenious plan has lately been devised
for sending the commodity in question through
the post!</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton, chemist, Holborn Bars, London, supplies,
not sea-water, but 'marine salts for the instantaneous
production of sea-water,' About six
ounces is sufficient to make a gallon, by the application
of <i>fresh</i> water. The saline material here
alluded to, is not an artificial chemical compound,
but is produced by the simple process of evaporating
sea-water itself. Those individuals so fortunate as
to possess a marine villa, or any other more humble
residence at or near the sea-coast, have no occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
to resort to the scheme above-mentioned for filling
their tanks, a pure supply of sea-water being attainable
with scarcely any trouble whatever. A stone
jar should be kept for this purpose only, and care
taken that the vessel is perfectly free from any
smell, as that of spirits, dirty corks, or the like, as
any such impurity would quickly spoil the water.</p>

<p>It may not be uninteresting to some of my readers
to know, that in France an aquarium cannot be
established with the same ease as in England. In
the former country 'the whole contents of the sea
itself is a contraband article,&mdash;that is, the contents
of the salt sea of the English Channel or the Atlantic
Ocean.' One writer tells us, that staying on the
French coast, he kept sea-anemones alive in glasses,
but was frequently warned by his friends to be careful
how he fetched water from the sea, lest the
custom-officers should interrupt him. 'My bottle,'
to use the writer's own words, 'being very small,
they let it pass, on the principle that the law does
not care about extremest trifles; had it been a pailful,
the case would have been different. A lady
keeping a marine aquarium, explained her wants to
the local head of the customs. He came and saw it&mdash;found
it beautiful, and being a gentlemanly man,
with some love for natural history, he gave a written
order for the procuring of any reasonable quantity of
water from the sea. Every time the needful element
was brought from the shore, it was accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
its passport, as formally as if it had been a cask of
wine, or a suspicious stranger. French salt sellers
thus enjoy the height of protection; they are
protected even from their colossal competitor, the
sea!'</p>

<p>I do not know a prettier sight than that exhibited
by a healthy aquarium on a fine summer's day;
the effect of the sunshine upon it being to cause
innumerable bubbles of oxygen&mdash;that look like balls
of quicksilver&mdash;to form on every weed, shell, and
smallest pebble. On looking through the transparent
sides of the vessel, small particles hitherto resting on
its base, may be seen slowly arising to the surface of
the water, each buoyed up by a miniature gas
balloon. The broad, ribbon like fronds of the ulva,
from the self-same cause, float upwards, and reflect a
beauteous emerald hue upon all objects that lie
beneath; while the glass bulb, placed in the tank as
before stated, to denote the density of the water, at
such a time belies its mission, and covered with
numerous argent globules, mounts gracefully in companionship
with the sea-weed, until shades of evening
approach, when its buoyancy gradually subsides,
and once more it falls to its original resting-place.</p>

<p>Wherever the above phenomenon is apparent, rest
assured that the aquarium is in good condition. It
is, in fact, to the oxygen thus given out by the
plants and infant vegetation that the animals owe
their existence. If no algæ were introduced, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
water would become impure, and unless changed
often, your little colony would surely die,&mdash;at least
those of its members who were unable to rise above
the fluid, and occasionally breathe the fresh air.</p>

<p>The secret herein involved, that animal and vegetable
respirations counterbalance each other, has only
of late years been discovered; yet it is apparent to
any observing eye at the sea-shore; there we never
meet with a rock-pool containing living animals, that
is not more or less adorned with sea-weeds.</p>

<p>The green Lettuce Ulva, so abundant in rock-pools,
the sea-grass, which covers almost every fixed object
at the sea-shore, or the well-known dulse or Chondrus
Crispus, form the only sea-weeds that it is necessary
to introduce into an aquarium. In fact, one or two
fronds of the Ulva Latissima alone, will answer perfectly
well to purify the water of even a comparatively
large tank. I have often been surprised to
find how small a quantity of algæ was required for
the purpose mentioned. After allowing a single
frond to float for a few days in a tank, in which some
sea-water was newly deposited, I took it out, and for
an entire twelvemonth the water remained healthy
and as clear as crystal.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the 'stock' of an aquarium
is quite a matter of taste; perhaps no two persons
adopt precisely the same plan. It may, therefore, be
advisable, as this matter is so arbitrary, for the
writer to state how his own tanks are mapped out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
leaving it to his readers to imitate the arrangements,
or adopt a style of their own as they may think
proper.</p>

<p>At one time I used to make a grounding of sand,
but this plan is not to be recommended, even though
it be one highly approved of by several species of
crabs, &amp;c. White pebbles do very well, but I now
prefer to cover the base of the tank with crushed
shells, washed very clean.</p>

<p>The following is a sketch of one of my tanks as
it at present stands:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the centre of the vessel is a <i>semi-circular arch</i>,
formed of pure white Sicilian marble, which has to
my eye a most pleasing appearance. Around it, and
indeed over the entire floor of the tank, are strewn
chippings of the same material as the centre piece
itself.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> From the arch, at certain intervals, hang
various sized specimens of the <i>Mytilus edulis</i>, which
have gradually advanced to their more or less elevated
positions entirely by their own unaided exertions.
Near hand a hardy <i>A. mesembryanthemum</i>
has taken up his abode, and sits with ever expanded
tentacles, motionless and happy. On either side of
the Anemone is deposited a riband of Doris spawn,
that undulates to and fro whenever by any chance
the water is in the slightest degree disturbed. Several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
soldier crabs, of course, act as sentinels of the
tank, and appear to be ever 'on duty,' marching
about in all parts of their subaqueous habitation;
while beneath the marble fragments repose, each
with his 'weather eye' open, a small <i>Maia squinado</i>,
two long-armed crabs, and a small <i>Carcinus mænas</i>.
On the sides of the vase rest a Limpet, a Trochus,
and two fine Periwinkles, with skin of glossy blackness.
The shells of either 'Buckie' is covered with
myriads of quicksilver globules, that rest on the tips
of the young and rising vegetation like dew upon the
bladed grass. As I write, upon the inner surface of
the water, like a fly upon the ceiling of a room, an
Eolis and two pearly white Dorides lie idly floating
in close companionship. Beneath them, upon the
verge of the aperture of a large empty whelk shell,
sits a pretty, cream-coloured Plumose Anemone (<i>A.
dianthus</i>). On two blocks of stone repose several
specimens of that mysterious animal the Pholas, who,
by my unkindness, are thus made to become members
of the marine 'houseless poor.' Several young
specimens of these bivalves are seated, in a piece of
rock, and daily engaged in 'boring.' A stick of
wood, formerly the slender twig of a tree, is thickly
clustered with fairy-handed acorn barnacles and serpulæ,
and being placed against the glass, the movements
of these singularly beautiful creatures can be
watched with ease. Then there are two Star-fishes,
a pack of three little Blennies, and a Five-bearded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Rockling, whose singular movements I have previously
alluded to. Against the arch some fronds of
ulva are anchored, while at chosen spots specimens
of delicate sea-weeds are also fixed&mdash;these rising up,
and being magnified through the sides of the vase,
have a pleasing effect, even to the eye of a child.</p>

<p>It is a pretty sight to watch the fishes glide under
and around the marble arch, or throw themselves
upon its highest point, there to enjoy the fresh air,
and have a pleasant 'crack' together. This expression
is literally correct, for the Blennies, when thus
situated, usually make a kind of noise not inaptly expressed
by snapping the nail of the thumb and finger
together.</p>

<p>The foregoing animals which constitute the entire
stock of one tank, are, I am proud to state, all in a
healthy condition, and if we may judge by appearances,
all contented and happy. It will be from no
fault of mine if they do not long continue thus, and
exhibit no signs of yearning for their native haunts
by the sea-shore.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Those gay watery grots&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">As if her trinkets nature chose to hide<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where nought invaded but the flowing tide.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In another tank I have introduced as a centre object
a fine piece of white coral, the higher branches
of which rise above the surface of the water. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
roughness of the coral seems to be much approved
of by many of the animals, who are not slow to
avail themselves of the facility thus afforded them
of climbing and otherwise exercising their peculiar
propensities. When purchasing coral, care must be
taken to procure a specimen that has not undergone
any cleaning process, for although such may be
more pleasing to the eye, it is not so suitable for a
'centre piece' as the cream-coloured, and less expensive
coral.</p>

<p>A third aquarium which I possess is fitted up in a
somewhat novel style, which offers, for certain purposes,
some slight advantages over others that I have
seen employed. It can be adopted in almost any
kind of tank; but the one under consideration is
circular in form, and is, in fact, a bell-shaped inverted
fern glass, the knob of which is sunk into a stand of
wood supported on three legs.</p>

<p>The plan alluded to, which was suggested to the
writer by an ingenious friend,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> consists of the introduction
of a floating centre piece composed of gutta
percha, which serves as a resting place for various
small animals, such as Actiniæ, Mussels, Barnacles,
Serpulæ, and even Pholades and Cockles. At the
base of the vessel, which is quite uncovered, rest
sundry members of the crustaceous family, whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
fishes of various kinds swim freely about over the
entire vessel free from all annoyance.</p>

<p>The question will doubtless be asked, 'How can I
procure the centre piece here spoken of?' I answer,
Make it yourself; a little skill combined with
patience and gutta percha being all that is required.
The following directions will serve to aid the young
reader who may wish to test his manipulative
powers.</p>

<p>Procure a thin piece of gutta percha, and lay it in
hot water for a few minutes until it is thoroughly
soft and pliable. Then get a globe&mdash;an orange will
do if nothing better offers&mdash;and cover it with the
above material. Having done this, throw it into
cold water, and when hard, cut the fruit in two, so
as to leave the gutta percha cast to the shape of each
half.</p>

<p>Next make a circular tray about eight or nine
inches in diameter, and turn up its edge about half
an inch all round. Then heat the brim of each cup,
and fasten them to the centre of the upper and
under part of the 'tray.' The structure will then
float in water. This, however, is not all that you
want, as your centre piece must always be entirely
immersed. First bore a few holes in the tray, then
fix a pretty shell, with a hole in it, to the base of the
lower 'cup,' and also form a loop of gutta percha,
from which to suspend, by means of a piece of silk,
a fragment of stone or marble of sufficient bulk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
balance the centre piece, and sink it an inch or two
below the surface of the water. At the centre of the
upper cup fasten a small piece of gutta percha tube,
at the end of which the valve of a Pecten may be attached
as an ornament. The whole structure must
be gently warmed and entirely coated with fine sand;
then tastefully decorated with shells and fronds of
green Ulva, and the crimson Delesseria Sanguinea.</p>

<p>Sometimes I introduce a globe of glass as a buoy,
and to its centre attach the tray of gutta percha.</p>

<p>A useful centre piece, a specimen of which I have
had in use for several months, may be formed thus.
Make a tripod of gutta percha, on the top of which
attach the valve of a Pecten. From the centre of this
object fix a branch of coral by aid of gutta percha,
in such a way that it rises above the water in the
tank. From under the shell pieces of coral may be
made to branch out in various directions. The stand
should be coated either with crushed shells or sand,
to give it an ornamental appearance.</p>

<p>It is often a source of annoyance to find the base
of the aquarium so thickly covered with dirt, &amp;c.
To get rid of this great 'eye sore,' without emptying
and re-arranging the tank, I call in the aid
of a very simple and effective instrument. By
its application all objectionable matter may be
gradually removed without in the slightest degree
disturbing the water, or materially displacing the objects
situated at the base of the vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>The instrument mentioned is composed of a gutta
percha globe, made in the manner previously described,
into one end of which is inserted a tube of
gutta percha or glass about four inches long, and
at the opposite end of the ball is introduced a second
tube about eight inches in length.</p>

<p>To use this instrument, close the orifice of the
longest tube, and plunge it into the water over any
spot where the debris is collected, then by removing
your finger from the end of the tube, <i>the impurity
will be instantly sucked up into the ball</i>. By again
placing the finger in its former position, the siphon
may be lifted out of the tank, and its contents
allowed to run off into a jug or basin placed near for
the purpose.</p>

<p>This operation must be repeated until the whole
of the offending particles are removed. Of course,
more water will be drawn off than is necessary, but
it can easily be poured back into the tank as soon
as the sediment has been fully precipitated.</p>

<p>Aquaria are generally much more difficult to keep
in order in summer than in winter, owing to the
rapid and profuse growth of minute vegetation which
renders the water opaque and exceedingly unpleasant
to the eye.</p>

<p>This ugly opacity I at one time attributed to decaying
animal matter, for I could scarcely believe
that the mere increase of the algæ spores could produce
such a vile effect. Experience, however, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
proved that the latter was in reality the true cause.
I tried often by syringing the water, or drawing it off
by means of the siphon, or stirring it about in all
manner of ways, to remove the objectionable muddiness,
but always without success. Limpets and
Periwinkles seemed quite useless. Nor did shutting
out the rays of light for a few days have any perceptible
effect in subduing the growth of the algæ which
collected with wondrous rapidity, and arrayed each
stone, shell, pebble, and even the poor crabs, in a
greenish garb.</p>

<p>I was therefore under the necessity, on several
occasions, of renewing the water, and considering
that my residence was several miles from the sea-coast,
this task was by no means a pleasant one.
What made matters still more provoking, was the
fact that the rejected fluid seemed perfectly free from
all offensive smell. I now adopt the following novel
method for removing the opacity of the water, without
the latter being changed, and also for preventing
the too abundant growth of the algæ at all seasons.</p>

<p>The plan in question (which requires, as already
shown, to be carried out with extreme caution by the
inexperienced aquarianist) is merely to dilute a small
quantity of <i>alum</i> in a wine-glass full of water, and
then mix it with the water contained in the aquarium.
A pellet of alum about the size of a pea is
sufficient for the purpose, if the tank be of moderate
size. And if inserted on the first appearance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
dimness in the water, much future trouble will be
saved.</p>

<p>Supposing the water to have become opaque,
proceed thus&mdash;Draw off a portion into a large jug,
and mix with it the diluted acid as before stated,
then let the jug remain undisturbed for about twelve
hours. The vegetation having been deposited in
flakes at the base of the vessel, the water should then
be gently strained off through a piece of fine muslin
into a second receptacle, which, in its turn, should be
allowed to stand for some time, and the contents
again strained as before. This process it is advisable
to repeat several times, until the whole of the fluid
in the tank has been thoroughly cleansed from impurity.</p>

<p>Should the water be returned too early, an unpleasant
fur coating will appear over the entire base
of the tank. This can be easily removed by means
of the siphon. Let one end of this instrument,
when in action, be passed gradually over the lower
portion of the vase, and in the course of a few minutes
every sign of 'fur' will be obliterated with the loss
of but a small portion of water. When once the
fluid has been clarified in the manner here mentioned,
there is little fear of the young aquarianist
being again troubled in like manner for many
months, the acid apparently preventing the algæ from
being reproduced to any such excess as hitherto.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Ehrenberg states that Infusoria are in a higher state of organization when taken

of Forth. Sir J. Dalyell terms it <i>A. explorator</i>. Local amateur naturalists frequently
reject the specific name of 'Troglodytes,' and adopt the more musical
appellation of 'Daisy-Anemone.' Such error seems very pardonable, when we remember
the close resemblance which the creature when expanded bears to the daisy
of the field. In no single instance have I met with specimens of the true <i>A. bellis</i>
at the above named locality, nor do I think any have ever been found by previous
naturalists.</p>

Lanarck, mentions the hinge as scarcely existing, and not being <i>a veritable ligament</i>.'
How different from the fact; and I will observe, that '<i>if there is a genus
better provided than any other of the bivalves with ligamental appendages, it is Pholas....
The Pholas is iron-bound as to ligament</i>, which in it is far more powerful in
securing the valves, than is the shell of any other group of the acephala, of
similar fragility and tenuity!'</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
